C) can a certain AN, a piece of this AC, than which
certainly the aforesaid Ac is greater, be equal to this
MH: otherwise (P. I.) the angles at the join HN would
be equal; which is absurd, as above.

Again however (in the hypothesis of an acute angle
at this point C), ii you take a certain AX, assumed on
AC produced, than which certainly the just mentioned
AC is less, equal to this MH; now by this same title the
anglesat HX will be equal; which assuredly is absurd
in the same way, as above.

It remains therefore, that indeed in the hypothesis of
an obtuse angle at this point C, the side Ac is less than
the opposite side MH; but in the hypothesis of an acute
angle is greater than it.

Quod erat intentum.

COROLLARY 11.

But by much more will CH be greater than any piece
of this AM, as for instance PM, since of course the join

[5]οΡ makes an angle still more acute with this CH
toward the parts of the point H, and obtuse (Eu. I. 16)
with this PM toward the parts oi the point M.

COROLLARY ΙΙΙ.

Again it abides that all things aforesaid equally result,
whether the assumed perpendiculars AC, and BD are oi

some length fixed by us, orare, or are supposed infini-
tesimal.

This indeed ought opportunely to be noted in remain-
ing subsequent propositions.

PROPOSITION IV.

But inversely (the figure of the preceding proposition
remaining) the angles ot the join C D will be right,
or obtuse, or acute, according os the straight CD is
equol, or lest, or preater than the opposite AB.
