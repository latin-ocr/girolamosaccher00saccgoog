But again AL cannot be the continuation of AN; be·
cause otherwise in the quadrilateral NDKL we would
have four right angles, against the hypothesis of acute
angle.

But neither can it cut DN produced in any exterior
point H; because angle AHN (from Eu. 1. 16) would
be acute, on account of the external angle AND supposed
right; and therefore angle DHL would be obtuse, and so
in the¹ quadrilateral DHLK we would have four angles,
which taken together would be greater than four right
angles, against the aforesaid hypothesis of acute angle.

Therefore it follows that the angle BAN must be cut
by this AL, and therefore cannot be declared the least of
all, drawn under which AN has with ΒΧ in two distinct
points a common perpendicular ND.

Ι Quod erat secundo loco demonstrandum. Itaque con-
stat etc.

COROLLARY.

But hence is permitted to obserye, that under a lesser
angle BAL is obtained (in the hypothesis of acute angle) a
common perpendicular LK, more remote indeed frorn the,
base AB, as follows from the construction, but moreover
less than the other nearer common perpendicular ND.
which is obtained under a greater angle BAN.

The reason of this latter is [67] because in the quadri-
lateral LKDS the angle at the point S is acute in the
aforesaid hypothesis, since the three remaining angles are
supposed right.

Wherefore (from Cor. I. to P. III.) the side LK

will be less than the opposite side SD, and so much le'ss
than the side ND.
