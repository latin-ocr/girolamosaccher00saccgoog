INTRODUCTION.

Giovanni Girolamo Saccheri was born at San Remo in
the night between the 4th and Sth of September, 1667, as
the authority on his life, the late Alberto Pascal tells us.

He was notably precocious.

March 24, 1685, he entered the Jesuit order. Toward
1690 he terminated the period ol novitiate at Genoa and
was sent by his superiors to the Collegio di Brera in Milan,
to teach grammar and at the same time to study philosophy
and theology. There the reading ol the Elements of Euclid
was recommended to him by the professor of mathematics,
the Jesuit father Tommaso Ceva, from whose brother Gio·
vanni the theom-Cera is named.

In 1694 Saccheri was commanded to teach philosophy
and polemio theology in the Collegio dei Gesuiti of Tutin.
In 1697 he was sent to Paula. Says Pascal, “Fruit ol these
three years ol philosophie reaching was a little book which
well merits to be better known: perhaps its extreme rarity

has contributed to this oblivion, even since Giovanni Vallati,
in 1903, brought to light its superlative merit.”
The few brief pages ol Vallati‚ who died in 1909, furnish

the only help on this libratio, an opera dimenticoto first ap
pearing with what he calls the titolo obbastanao enipmotico:

Lupica demonstrativa, qnam uno cum Thesibus ex toto
Philosophia decerptis, defendendam proponit Ioannes Fron-
circns Casolette Groveriornm Comes suh auspicio Rapiae
Celsitudinis Victorii Amedei II. Sobondide Ducis, Pede·
montinm Principis, Cypri Rapis, etc.
