totally approach each other ever more without any

from which are let foll to the straight ΒΧ perpen-

Pnoos. The first part follows indeed from Cor. Ι. to
P. XXIII. The second part however is proved thus. For
the two angles together at LK toward
the base AB are greater (from Cor. ι
to P. XVI.) than the two interna]
and opposite angles together at HK
toward the same base AB.
But the angles at each point K
toward the base AB are equal to each
other, as being right. Therefore the
obtuse angle at L toward the base Π
ΑΒ is greater than the obtuse angle Α 1213, 33,
at H toward the same base ΑΒ.

In like manner is shown that the aforesaid obtuse
angle at H is greater than the obtuse angle at the point D.
And thus ever, proceeding toward the points X.

Finally the third part requires a longer disquisition.
If therefore it can be done, let there be assigned (fig. 34)
a certain angle MNC, than which is always greater, or
anyhow not less, the exeess of any of the aforesaid obtuse
angles above a right angle. It follows (from P. XXI.)
that the sides NM, NC comprehending that angle MNC

can be so produced that the perpendicular MC from a
certain point M of MN [⁶1] let fall upon NC may be ·
