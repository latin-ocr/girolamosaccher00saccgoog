the internal· and opposite angle (which then would be·

Therefore I have rightly supposed the side DF of
one triangle to ,be less than the side Ac of the other
triangle‚ in accordance with the hypothesis now es-
tablished.

Wherefore from any two triangles mutually equian·
’ gular‚ but not also mutually equilateral, the Euclidean
postulate is established. Quod intendebatur. ’

SCHOLION IV.

I n which is expuunded oa a fipure a certain consideration
on which Euclid probably thoupltt, in order to estab-
vlish that postulate of his or per se evident.

Ι premise first: within any acute angle BAX (fig. 12)
can be drawn from any [42] point X ol AX a certain
straight XB, under any designated (even obtuse) angle
R (provided only that R with the acute BAX falls short
ol two right angles); Ι say, a certain XB can be drawn,
which at a finite remove meets AB in a certain point B.

For just that I have already demonstrated in a scho
lion atter P. XIII.

I premise secondly: these ΑΒ, AX (fig. 25) can be
understood as produced ia infinitum even to certain points
Y, and Z; and likewise the aforesaid XB (produced in
infinitum even to a point Y) can be understood to be
