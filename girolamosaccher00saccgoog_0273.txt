is manifest no refutation follows hence, which therefore
only demolishes the hypothesis of acute angle.

In this place however some one perchance may inquire,
whyI am so solicitous about proving exact the refutation
of each false hypothesis. To the end, say I, that thence
may be more completely established that not without
cause was that famous airiom assumed by Euclid as
known perse. For chiefly this seems to be as it were
the character of every primal verity, that precisely by a
certain recondite argumentation based upon its very con·
tradictory, assumed as true, it can be at length brought
back to its own self. And I can avow that thus it has
turned out happily forme right on from early youth in
reference to the consideration of certain primal verities
as is known from my Lopico demonstrativo.

Thence now I may proceed to explain, why in the

Preface to the Reader I have said: not without o preat ¹
sin against ripicl topic turo equidistant straight lines bove' v

been assumed by some as given. [100]

Where I should point out that none oi those is carped
at, whom I have mentioned even indirectly in this book
. of mine, because they are truly great geometers, and
verily free from this sin.

But I say: preat sin against riyid logie: for what else
is it to assume as given tivo equidistant straight liner:
unless either to assume 3 that every line equidistant in the
same plane from a certain supposed straight line is itself
also a straight line ; or at least to suppose, that some one
thus equidistant may be a straight line, as if therefore it
were allowable to make assumption, whether by hypoth-
esis, or by postulate, of any such distance of one from
another? But it is certain neither of these can be made
traffic of as if per se known.

F orsooth the objective concept of a line, which in all

its points is equidistant from a certain supposed straight
