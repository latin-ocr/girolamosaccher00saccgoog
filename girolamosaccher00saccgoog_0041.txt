of all who have learned mathematics, none can fail
to know how great is the excellence and worth of Euclid’s

medes, Apollonius‚ Theodosius, and others almost in-
numerable, writers on mathematics even to our times.

and wholly unshaken. But this so great celebrity has not
prevented many, ancients as well as moderns, and among
them distinguished geometers, maintaining they had
found certain blemishes in these most beauteous nor ever

The first pertains to the definition of parallels and
with it the axiorn ,which in Clavius is the thirteenth of
