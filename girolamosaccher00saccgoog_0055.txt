PART 1.

PROPOSITION Ι.

Is two equol stroiohts [sects] (fio. 1) Ac, BD, make
wito the stroioht ΑΒ onoles equo! toward the some
ports: I say thot the onoles ol c

the join CD will be mutuolly = VD

equol.

PRooF. Join AD, CB. Then a
consider the triangles CAR, DBA. Α

It follows (Eu. 1. 4) that the bases mg· 1· Β
CB, AD will be equal.
Then consider the triangles ACD, BDC. It follows

(Eu. Ι. 8) that the angles ACD, BDC will be equal.
