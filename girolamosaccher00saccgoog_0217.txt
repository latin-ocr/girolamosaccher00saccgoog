AXB, and AXC produced through the point X in the
same plane. Then with center X, and radius XB, or XC,
describe the arc BMC, to any point of which M is drawn
from the first point X the straight XM.

I say first, under the assumed hypothesis also the line
AXM will be [7⁴] a straight line,
continued from the point A through L
the point X.

For if a line of this sort be not
straight, there can be drawn (from
Cor. 1. of the preceding lemma) a
certain other line AM, which itseli
is straight. But this either cuts in
some point K one or the other oi
those straights XB, XC; or it in·
closes one or the other oi them, as suppose XB within
the space bounded by AX, XM, and APLM.

But the first ol these is manifestly contrary to the
preceding lemma; because thus two lines supposed
straight, one AXK, and the other ATK, would inclose
aspace.

But the second is at once convicted oi a like absurdity.

For it is certain that the straight XB, ii produced on
through Β, will at length meet this APLM in some point
L; whence again two lines supposed straight, one AXBL,
and the other APL‚ will incloseaspace. Butalike absurdity
iollows, if we assume, that the straight XB, produced on
through Β, at length meets in¹ some other point either the
straight XM, or the straight XA.

But irom this evidently follows that the line AXM
is itsell, in the assumed hypothesis, the straight line
drawn from the point A to the point M.

Quod erat propositum.

Ι say secondly‚ that the assumed straight AXB (inas-
