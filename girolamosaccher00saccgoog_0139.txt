lingly permit what he postulates; since just that, which
with him remains undemonstrated‚ can be recognized as
most rigorously demonstrated by me in Cor. ΙΙ. to P. ΙΙΙ.

The other postulate of Nasiraddin is the reciprocal

ol the first; that indeed the angle may always be acute
toward those parts [39] where the just mentioned per-
pendiculars are supposed to become shorter; but obtuse
toward the other parts where these perpendiculars are
supposed to go out always longer. But here lurks an
ambiguity.

For why (while from any one perpendicular pre·
scribed as the first we proceed to the others) may not the
angles of the consequent perpendiculars, on the same side
acute, not become ever greater, even to where one strikes
upon a right angle, consequently upon such a perpendicu-
laras is itself the common perpendicular to each of the
κ aforesaid straights? And if indeed that happens, evan·
ishes this subtle preparation of Nasiraddinby means of
which ingeniously indeed, but with great labor he demon-
strates the Euclidean postulate.

And yet if Nasiraddin with a certain justice may de·
termine to presume as if known per se that persistence
of acute angles on the same side: why cannot also (Ι
, speak with Wallis) be assumed as ii clear per se: Two ¹
straights in the some plone couverpiup (upon which of
course another straight striking makes toward the same
parts two angles less than two right angles, as suppose
one right, and the other in whatever way acute) finally
meet, if produced? «

Nor in fact can it be objected, that this greater con·
vergence toward one side can always subsist within a
certain determinate limit, so that indeed a certain so
much of distance always intervenes between these lines

on this side, even if still one approaches always more
nearly to the other.
