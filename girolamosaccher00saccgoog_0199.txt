AB with BX; if any straight AZ is drawn toward the
same parts under an obtuse angle, it follows there can ·
be toward these parts in two distinct points no common
perpendicular to AZ, ΒΧ. Otherwise from the resulting
quadrilateral containing four angles greater than four
right angles, we hit (from P. XVI.) upon the already
rejected hypothesis ol obtuse angle, against the hypothesis
ol acute angle in this place assumed.

Therelore that perpendicular AY will be from that
side an intrinsic limit ol all the straights which drawn

ἶ “ from the point A toward the same parts have (in the

hypothesis of acute angle) at two distinct points a com·
mon perpendicular with the other unbounded straight ΒΧ,

Quod erat primum. ’

Paoor os rens Sucowo Pnar. For if it were possible,
let a certain acute angle be the least of all, drawn under
which AN has with ΒΧ in two distinct points the common
perpendicular ND. Then in ΒΧ a higher point K being
assumed, from this erect to ΒΧ the perpendicular KL.

, upon which somne point Aret ran (by su. 1. 12) the
¹ perpendicular AL.
But now, if this AL meets ND in any point S, it cer-

tainly follows that angle BAL will be less than BAN. .

which therefore will not be the least of all drawn under
which AN has with ΒΧ in two distinct points a common
perpendicular ND. [66]

But furthermore that the aforesaid perpendicular ND
is cut by this perpendicular AL in some intermediate
point of it S is thus demonstrated. ι

And first indeed, that ΒΚ cannot be cut by AL in any
point M follows absolutely from Eu. Ι. 17, since other-
wise in the same triangle MKL we would have two right
angles at the points K and L, apart from the fact that in
this case we would have our assertion about that angle
BAN, that it is not in such circumstances the least of all.
