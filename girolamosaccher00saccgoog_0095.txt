Ι. 16) is greater not alone than the right angle BPA but
also, for the same reason, than any obtuse angle BXA,
the point X being assumed wherever you choose within

this ΡΑ, and indeed always greater as the point X is ’

assumed nearer to the point A (Eu. Ι. 16): it is an
evident consequence, [19] that between those angles, one
oi 90 degrees at the point P, and the other of 92 degrees
at the point A, one angle BXA is found, which is 91
degrees, truly equa] to the given angle R.

None the less, omitting here the last observation about
the obtuse angle, it is necessary most diligently to take
care that the difficulty of this assumption oi Euclid be
fixed in this, that it asserts the meeting of two straights ;

in particular in that part toward which they make with ,

the cutting straight two angles together less than two
right angles; and assuredly that it asserts the aforesaid
meeting thus, of whatever length be the assigned trans-
versat.

However (as Ι have already mentioned in the pre-
ceding scholion) I shall demonstrate the general meeting
solely from the admitted meeting oi this sort when one
oi the angles is right; and indeed even if it be admitted
not for any assignable finite transversal, but alone ad-
mitted within the limits of any assigned very small trans-
versal.

PROPOSITION XIV.

The hypothesis of obtuse angle is absolutely false, be-
cause it destroys itself.

Pnoos. From the hypothesis of obtuse angle, as·
sumed as true, we have now deduced the truth oi Euclid's
postulate: that two straights will meet each other in
some point toward those parts, toward which a certain
straight, cutting them, makes two internal angles, oi
whatever kind, less than two right angles.
