PROPOSITION XVI.

By any quadrilateral ABCD, of which the four onples
together are equol to, or preater, or less than four
riplrt angles, is established respectively tlte hypothesis
of right anple, or obtuse anple, or ocule angle.

Pnoor. Join AC. The three angles of the triangle
ΑΒΕ (fig. 14) will not bc together equal to, or greater,

or less than two right angles,

without the three angles of the Α ⁵
triangle ADC being ‘themselves
also together respectively equal o

to, or greater, or less than two
right angles, lest-obviously (by
the preceding) from one of
those triangles be established one hypothesis, and another
from the other, against the fifth, sixth, and seventh prop
ositions of this work.

This holding good: If the four angles together ol the
premised quadrilateral are equal to four right angles, it
follows that the three angles together of either of the
just mentioned triangles will be equal to two right angles,
and therefore (from the preceding) [2³1 the hypothesis
of right angle will be established.

But if indeed the four angles of this quadrilateral be
together greater, or less than four· right angles, similarly
the three angles together of those triangles should be
respectively either at the same time greater, or at the same
’ time less than two right angles. Wherefore from these
triangles would be established respectively (from the pre-
ceding) either the hypothesis of obtuse angle, or the hy·
pothesis of acute angle.

Therefore by any quadrilateral‚ of which the four
· angles together are equal to, or greater, or less than four
