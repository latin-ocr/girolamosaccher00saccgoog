Here, for instance, is the demonstration in nobiliorem
viom ol the noted rule ol the scholastic logic according to
which in syllogisms of the so·called First Figure (in syllo-
gisms, namely, in which the subject and the predicate of the
conclusion enter respectively as subject and predicate also
in the premises), the premise in which appears the subject
oi the conclusion cannot be negative: In prinu figura minor
non potest esse nepotioo.

Taking the simplest particular case, it is to be proved
that irom the two propositions:

Every A is a B,
No C is an A,

can be inferred no general proposition (affirmative or nega·
tive) having C as subject and B as predicate.

Proposing to demonstrate this rule by means ol only the
syllogism Barbara, which has its two premises universal and
affirmative, Saccheri first observes that his aim would be
attained it, lor each of the different forms oi syllogismo
with negative minor premise constructible in the first figure,
he could succeed in finding examples (that is, could choose

such particular meanings lor the ternis entering) for which
the two premises being true, the conclusion was false:

“Si quispiam syllogismus taliter constructus non recte
concludit, nullus alius similiter constructus vi formae con·
cludet’' (Lopico dem, p. 130).

[Is this Italy, 1697, or America, 1919?]

For example, to prove that, from the two premises

Every A is a B,
No C is an A,

we cannot deduce the conclusion

NoCisaB.

Attribute to the terms A, B, C, respectively the three
following significatione: ,
A=syllogism ol the first figure, having the two promises
universal and affirmative;
B = a valid syllogisrn ;
