C=syllogism oi the first figure having one premise neg-
Thffiz· premises ’

Every A is a B,
No C isan A,

will then become the two following propositions:

1. Every syllogism of the first ¹figure having the two
premises universal and affirmative is a valid syllo-
grsm:

2. No syllogism of the first ligure having one premise '
negative, is a syllogism of the first figure having the
two premises universal and affirmative.

Now these two premises both being true, we must either

admit as true the conclusion:

NoCisaB

(that is, No syllogism oi the first figure having one premise
negative is a valid syllogism), or else concede that the mean-
ings we have given to the terms A, B, C of the syllogism
whose validity is in question, render true its two promises
and false its conclusion.

In either case we are equally iorced to admit that the
syllogism in question is not valid.

“Vel concedis vel negas consequentiam. Si concedis,
habetur intentum Si negas, conclusioni dissentiens post
concessas praemissas, fateris ipse legitimum non esse ex

praemissis eiusmodi consequentiam quod intendebatur”
(Loqiea dem, p. 132).

His teaching of logie ended, his course published, its
weapon oi predilection, IX-12, left in his poweriul hands,
in his new field, mathematics, what heroic adventure was
worthy its trenchant edge?

Sir Henry Savile, in his Proelectiones tresdecim in prin-
cipium Elementorum Euclidis habitae 1620, Oxlord, 4⁰,
1621, p. 140, says: “In pulcherrimo Geometriae corpore
duo sunt naevi.'' ⁴
