Pnoor. For if the straight CD is equal to the opposite
AB, and nevertheless the angles at it are either obtuse, or
acute; now these such angles prove it (P. ΙΙΙ.) not
equal, but lesS, or greater than the opposite ΑΒ; which
is absurd against the hypothesis.

The same uniformly avails in regard to the remain-
ing cases. It holds therefore that the angles at the join
CD are either right, or obtuse, or acute, according as the
straight CD is equal to, or less, or greater than the oppo
site ΑΒ.

Quod erat demonstrandum.

DEFINITIONS.

Since (P. Ι.) the straight joining the extremities of
equal perpendiculars standing upon the same straight
(which we call base), makes equal [⁶] angles with these
perpendiculars; therefore there are three hypotheses to
be distinguished according to the species of these angles.
’ And the first indeed I will call hypothesis of right angle:

the second however, and the third Ι will call hypothesis

· of obtuse angle, and hypothesis of acute angle.

PROPOSITION V.

If even in a single case the hypothesis of right anyle
is true, always in every case it alone is true.

Pnoon. Let the join CD (fig. 4) p '
make right angles with any two per- ”k-
pendiculars AC, BD, standing upon L
any straight AB. Ο

CD will be equal to this AB. As·
sume in Ac, and BD produced two
sects CR, DX, equal to these AC, BD; i ' “
and join RX. We may easily show ⁴
that the join RX will be equal to this
AB, and the angles at it right. And first indeed by
