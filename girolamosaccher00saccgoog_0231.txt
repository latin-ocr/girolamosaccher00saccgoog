has J'ust now been proved) those others, AXB, and AXM,
without any change of their prolongatioris, can, with the
same fixed AX, take other positions in the same plane,
such as AXC and AXF.

Therefore alone AXD, whose prolongation XD not
only isin the same plane with AX, but also lies alto-
gether in like manner toward the left, and the right side
of the aforesaid AX, is a straight line in accordance with
the discusscd definition, or the prolongation in a straight
of the assumed straight AX.

From all which finally is established as impossible,
that one segment can be common to two [81] straight lines.

Quod erat demonstrandum.

⁵ couorrnnr.

From the two preceding lemmata three things may
opportunely be noted.

One is: not even with an infinitely small distance be-
tween them can two straights inclose a space.

The reason is, because (just as in Lemma Ι) either
each oi them with the two common extreme points fixed
can be revolved into occupying a new position, andso
(from the definition of the straight line already given)
neither will be a straight line: or only one remains in the
same place, and so it alone is a straight line.

But that both cannot remain in the same place, while
they inclose any space, even if infinitely little, will be
manifest from considering that a face of the plane, in
which the two are, can be converted from upper to lower,
the two extreme points withal remaining in the same

place. .
Another is: nor moreover can any straight line, in

any direct production of it, split into tw0‚ although with
an interval infinitely small.

The reason is, because (just as in the preceding
