the angle DFM, and therefore greater (Ρ. vm, in the
hypothesis of obtuse angle) than the external angle XAH,
or its vertical CAF.
ἵ Wherefore (since the angles CAM, FMA are taken
equal, as being right) the remaining angle DMA would
be less than the remaining angle DAM. This is absurd
(against Eu. Ι. 5), if indeed DM be equal to DF. or DA.
But neither is DM less than DF, or DA. Otherwise
(Eu. Ι. 18) the angle DMF would be greater than the
angle DFM, and therefore still greater (in the hypothesis
of obtuse angle) than the external angle XAH, or its
vertieal CAD. Wherefore again, as above, the remain-

ι ing angle DMA would be still less than the remaining

angle DAM. But this is absurd (against Eu. Ι. 18) if
indeed DM be less than DF, or DA.

It remains therefore, that the join DM is greater thau
DF, or DA, and therefore (P. X.) ΒΜ is greater than

Quod erat hoc loco intentum.

Since therefore, assuming in AD produced the inter-
val AF double the interval AD, the perpendicular ΡΜ let
fall on the transversal ΑΡ cuts off from it more than

double what is cut off by the perpendicular let fall from
the point D: [¹6] more quickly by far in 'this hypothesis
of obtuse angle, than in the preceding hypothesis of right
angle, we attain to an interval so great, that from it the
perpendicular let fall cuts off a base greater than the
designated ΑΡ however great.

But this, as in the preceding proposition, could not ’
happen, unless after the meeting of the produced AD

with PL in some point; and indeed at a finite, or termi-
nated distance. ¹
