quadrilateral KTSK are greater than any sum ol angles,

which lacks however little you choose ol being four right
angles; since already it has been shown that a quadri·
lateral KHLK ean always be designated‘ such [54] that
its four angles together shall fall short of four rights
by less than any assignable part ol a right„ Therefore
the four angles together ol this stable and given quadri-
lateral either are equal to four rights or greater.

But then (from P. XVI.) is established the hypoth-
esis either of right angle or ol obtuse angle; and there-
¹lore (from Propp. V. and VI.) the hypothesis ol acute .
angle is destroyed.

So is established that the hypothesis of acute angle
will be destroyed, il two straights existing in the same
plane so approach each other mutually ever more, that
nevertheless their distance is always greater than any
assigned length.

Hoc autem erat demonstrandum.

COROLLARY 1.

But (the hypothesis ol acute angle destroyed) the
controverted Euclidean postulate is manifest from P.

XIII. ; just asin Scholion HI. after P. XXI, where we
spoke of the attempt of the Arab Nasiraddin‚ I promised
would be diselosed by me in this place.

COROLLARY II.

On the other hand from this proposition, and from
the preceding P. XXIII. is manifestly gathered that the
two following points are not sufficient for establishing
Euclidean geometry. One is: that we designate by the
name ol parallels those straights, which existing in the

same plane possess a common perpendicular. The second
indeed, that all straights existing in the same plane, of
