But that the thing goes otherwise in the hypothesis oi
acute angle, follows irom what is said above.

From this scholion therefore and from the other after
P. XIII. may be realized, that a wholly different way
was to be taken in refuting each ialse hypothesis, one oi
obtuse angle, and the other oi acute angle.

Moreover it is easy in like manner to recognize from
these, that it can only be a straight line CD, which in all
its points is equidistant from the assumed straight line

PROPOSITION XXXIX.

I f upon two straight lines another straipht striking makes
toward the same parts anates less than taoo right
anytes, those two straipht lines produced in infinitum
meet each other toward those parts where are the
anytes less than two ripht angles.

This is the temous Euclidean axiam, which at length
I undertake absolutely to demonstrate.

For this end however it will be sufficient to recall
some oi the preceding demonstrations. Therefore in my
propositions, up to P. VII. inclusive, Ι have distinguished
three hypotheses about the straight joining the extreme
points oi two equal perpendiculars, which stand upon
a certain straight, that I call base, in the same plane.

Furthennore in regard to these hypotheses (which in
turn Ι distinguish from the species oi the angles, which
are supposed to be made at the jain) I demonstrate that
any one of them, forsooth either oi right angle, or obtuse
angle, or acute angle, alone is true always and in every
case, if even in one case it be true.

Then in P. XIII. I show the universal truth oi the
controverted axiam, when occurs either the hypothesis
of right angle, oroi obtuse angle. ·
