superposition oi the quadrilateral ABDC upon the quad·
rilateral CDXR, applied to the common base CD.

Also we may proceed more elegantly thus. Join
AD, RD. It follows (Eu. I. 4) in the triangles ACD,
RCD, the bases AD, RD will be equal and likewise the
angles ΕΒΑ, CDR, and certainly ADB, RDX because
equal remainders from a right angle. Whereby in tum
(Eu. Ι. 4) in the triangles ADB, RDX, the base AB will

be equal to the base RX. Therefore (P. IV.) the angles
at the join RX will be right, and so we abide in the same

¹ hypothesis of right angle.

Since now the length of the perpendiculars can be
similarly increased infinitely, under the same base AB,
the hypothesis of right angle always subsisting‚ it only
remains to be proved that the same hypothesis will always
abide in any case of diminution of those perpendiculars;
which indeed is thus evinced. [7]

Assume in AR, and ΒΧ any two equal perpendiculars
AL, ΒΚ, and join LK. If the angles at the join LK
are not right, nevertheless (P. Ι.) they will be equal to
each other. Thereiore they will be toward one part, as
suppose toward AB obtuse, and toward RX acute, since
certainly the angles here at each of those points are
(Eu. Ι. 13) equal to two rights.

But it also holds that the perpendiculars LR, KX,
those standing upon Rx, will be mutually equal. There·
fore (P. ΙΙΙ.) LK will be greater indeed than the oppo-
site RX, and less than the opposite AB.

But this is absurd; because ΑΒ, and RX have been
shown equal. Thereiore the hypothesis of right angle

ε is not changed by any diminution oi the perpendiculars,
.· whilst abides the once posited base AB.

But neither is the hypothesis oi right angle changed

‚ ior any diminution, or greater amplitude of the base;
since manifestly may be considered as base any perpen-
