and join DM. Ι should show that the join DM will be
equal to DF, or DA.

And in the first place indeed DM cannot be greater
than DF. For otherwise the angle DMF would be less
(Eu. Ι. 18) than the angle DFM, or its equal (P. Vm„
in the hypothesis ol right angle) the angle XAH, or its
vertical CAD. Wherefore (since the angles CAM, FMA
are assumed equal, as being right) the remaining angle
DMA would be greater than the remaining angle DAM.
But this is absurd (against Eu. Ι. 18) if indeed DM is
taken greater than DF or DA.

— But neither will DM be less than this DF. Otherwise

the angle DMF would be greater (Eu. Ι. 18) than the
angle DFM, or its equal (P. VIII„ in hypothesis of right
angle) the angle XAH, or its vertical CAD. Wherefore
again, as above, the remaining angle [14] DMA will not
be greater, but less than the remaining angle DAM. But
this is absurd (against Eu. Ι. 18) if indeed DM is taken
less than DF, or DA.

It remains therefore, that the join DM is equal to
DF, or DA. Wherefore in the triangle DAM (Eu. I. 5)
the angles at the points A, and M will be equal; and there·
fore in the triangles DBA, DBM, right-angled at B, the
bases AB, ΒΜ will be equal (Eu. Ι. 26). This indeed
was here our aim. ι

Since therefore (assuming in AD produced the inter·
val AF double the interval AD) the perpendicular ΡΜ

, let fall on the transversal ΑΡ cuts off from ΑΡ toward

P a base AM double ΑΒ, which the perpendicular let fall
from the point D curs off ; it is manifest that this dupli·
cation of the preceding interval can be so many times
repeated, that thus in AD continued we attain to a cer-
tain point T, from which the perpendicular let fall upon
ΑΡ prolonged cuts off a certain AR greater than the
finite ΑΡ however great.
