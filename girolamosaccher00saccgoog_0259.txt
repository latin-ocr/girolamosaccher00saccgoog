y indeed point D pertaining to that semicircumference
, comes to congruence with'point A, so that moreover

point B, the other extreme point of the same semicircum·
ference comes to congruence with point C.

This abiding; if in the semicircumierence BLD is
designated any point L, to which in the described straight
line BA corresponds point M, from which in that plane

, is erected the perpendicular MK, equal to BD: I say that

ἢ point K will be the point H diametrically opposite the

point L.

For there in the point M, or L the straight AB

: touches the aforesaid circle. Therefore MK perpendicu-

ἰ lar to AB will go (from Eu. ΙΙΙ. 19, which is assuredly
’ independent of the controverted axiom) through the

center of the same circle. Wherefore3 where point L in
that revolution of the circle BLDH comes to congruence

with the point M oi AB, also point H, diametrically oppo-
site the aforesaid point L, falls upon point K of MK.

F urthennore it is certain the same holds in like manner
ol the remaining points of the semicircumference BLD,
and of those diametrically correlative in the other semicir-
cumference BHD. Whereiore the line, in that way succes-
sively described by the points of the semicircumference
BHD‚ will be the already considered DKC, which in all
its points is equidistant from the straight BA ; and which
therefore (in accordance with the hypothesis of acute
angle) is always concave toward the side of AB.

But thence follows, that the point M in BA may be
considered exactly equal to point K in DKC, because of
[94] their equality in every way with the points L, and H
diametrically opposite in the circle BLDH.

Wherefore ; since the same holds of all points ol the

' described straight BA, if they be compared with the other

uniformly opposite in the aforesaid assumed curve DKC;
the consequence evidently is, that this curve, born of the
