PROPOSITION XXXIV.

In witichis investigated a certain curve orisinp from the
ι hypothesis of acute anple.²

Let the straight CD join equal perpendiculars AC, BD
standing upon a certain straight ΑΒ. Then AB, CD being

bisected in the points M and H (fig. 42), ΜΗ is j0ined
perpendicular (by P. ΙΙ.) to each

Again in this hypothesis the an· Aa*

gles at the Jorn CD are supposed 0
acute. Therefore in the quadri·
lateral AMHC (by Cor. Ι. to P
ΙΙΙ.) ΜΗ will be less than Ac
Hence now, if in MH produced ,

ΜΚ be taken equal to Ac, the
points C, K, D pertain to the
curve here investigated. Then the angles at the join
CK will be themselves acute (by P. VII.).

Therefore the join LX, which bisects, and therefore
(by P. ΙΙ.), is at right angles to AM, CK, will be like-
wise (by Cor. Ι. to P. ΙΙΙ.) less than AC. Wherefore, if
in LX produced we assume LF equal to AC or MK, the
point F also will pertain to this curve. Further, joining
CF, and FK we find likewise two other points pertaining
to the same curve And so on forever.

¹1n the hypothesis of acute angle an equidistant ol a straight has
