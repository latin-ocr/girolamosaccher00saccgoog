does not cut the curve. Therefore infinitesimal K, re·
garding the curve, will be wholly equal to infinitesimal K
regarding the tangent But it is certain the infinitesimal
K regarding the tangent is neither greater nor less than, ·
but exactly equal to the infinitesimal M regarding the
base AB; because obviously the straight MK may be
supposed described by the flow always unifonn of the
point M opto the summit K s

Wherefore (according to the premised axiom) the
curve CKD, born of the hypothesis of acute angle should
be equal to the opposite base AB.

Quod erat demonstrandum.

But perchance to some one will seem by n0 means·
evident the enunciated exact equality between the infini-
tesimals M, and K. Wherefore to remove this scruple
I again proceed thus.

To a certain straight AB let two equal straights Ac,
BD (fig. 48) stand at right angles in the same plane.

Fig. 48.

Again in the same plane suppose thero is a circle
BLDH, whose diameter is BD; and let the semicircum·
ference BLD be equal [⁹³] to the aforesaid AB. Further
let the same circle be conceived so to be revolved in that
plane upon the straight AB that with motion always
continuous and uniform it achieves or describes with the
points of its semicircumference the aforesaid BA, until
