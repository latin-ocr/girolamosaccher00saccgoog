But if however the angle CAD, or its vertical XAH,
be less, or greater than the internal or opposite ADB;
¹ also the join CD will be (Eu. Ι. 24) less or greater than
AB ; and therefore (P. IV.) will be true respectively the
hypothesis oi obtuse angle, or acute angle.

Quae omnia erant demonstranda.

PROPOSITION IX.
In any right-onpled trianple the two acute angles ¹re·

maininp ore, taken together, equol to one ripht anple,
in the hypothesis of ripht anple; preater than one
ripht ohple, in the hypothesis of obtuse onple; bur
less in the hypothesis of acute anple.

Pnoor. Foris the angle XAH (fig. 7) is equal to
the angle ADB‚ which is certain from the preceding
proposition in the hypothesis of right angle, then the
angle ADB makes up with the angle HAD two right
angles, as (Eu. Ι. 13) the aforesaid angle XAH makes
them up with this angle HAD. Wherefore, the right
angle ΗΑΒ being subtracted, the two angles ADB and
BAD remain together equal to one right angle.

Quod erat primum.

However, if the angle XAH is less than the angle
ADB‚ which is certain from the preceding proposition
in the hypothesis of obtuse angle, then the angle ADB
makes up with the angle HAD more than two right
angles, since with it (Eu. Ι. 13) the angle XAH makes
up two. Wherefore, the angle ΗΑΒ being subtracted,
the two angles ADB and BAD will be together greater
than one right angle.

Quod erat secundum.

F inally, if the angle XAH be greater than the angle
ADB‚ which is certain from the preceding proposition
in the hypothesis of acute angle, then the angle ADB will
make up less than two right angles with the angle HAD,
