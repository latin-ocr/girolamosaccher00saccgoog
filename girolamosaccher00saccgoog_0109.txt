minated distance) on account of the right angles at the
points H and D. Therefore in the hypothesis oi acute
angle it cannot hold good, that any BD, making with
a straight AB, however small, any acute angle toward
the parts of this AH, perpendicular to this same AB,
will at length meet (at a finite or terminated distance)
this AH produced.

SCHOLION I.

And this is what I promised in the scholia alter
P. ΧΙΙΙ., that the hypothesis of acute angle (which alone
is able now to stand against that general Euclidean as-
sumption) will certainly be destroyed by the sole ad-
mission oi a universal meeting oi two straights toward
those parts toward which any straight, as small as you
choose, meeting them, makes two internal angles less than
two right angles; and just s0, even if either of those
angles is to be supposed right.

SCHOLION 11.

But again in a better place, after P. XXVII„ Ι shall
show that the hypothesis oi acute angle will be equally
destroyed, provided that any one acute angle as small as
