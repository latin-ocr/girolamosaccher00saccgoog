the same will hold, ii the same mixed quadrilateral ANFC
in either mode is supposed to be superposed to any of the
remaining quadrilaterals even to the last quadrilateral
BDFI inclusive.

Therefore the angle of AC with the curve is equal to
either of the angles with this curve of the aforesaid
perpendiculars on either side at the points F, or at the
mMKmmmD

Hence follows secondly that the portions of the curve
cut off on each side by these perpendiculars are exactly
equal to one another. .

If therefore the base AB be bisected in M, and the
half AM bisected in L; then the quarter LM bisected in
P; and so in infinitum, proceeding always toward the
parts of the point M; it will follow thirdly‚ also the curve
CKD is bisected in K by the perpendicular MK, the half
CK in like manner bisected in F by the perpendicular LF,
the quarter FK bisected in F by the perpendicular PF;
and so in infinitum, proceeding always uniformly toward
the parts of the point K.

But since in this division of the base AB in infinitum
we may [92] consider the thing to have arrived at a portion
of AB infinitely small, which obviously may be exhibited
by the infinitely small breadth of the perpendicular MK,
fourthly (from the premised axiom) will follow the as-
serted equality of the whole base AB with the whole curve
CKD, if only I now can show the infinitely small portion
cut off from the base AB by the perpendicular MK to be
exactly equal to the infinitely small portion. which the
same perpendicular cuts off from the curve CKD.

And this last I thus demonstrate.

For RK perpendicular to KM touches (from P.
XXXV.) the curve at K, and touches this in K so, that
between the tangent (from Cor. to P. XXXVI.) and the
curve from neither side can be placed a straight, which
