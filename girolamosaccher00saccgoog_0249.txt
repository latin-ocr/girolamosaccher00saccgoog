Pnoos. Il is sure that some point X may be assumed
in XF so near to the point F, that the join LX previously
cuts the curve in some point S:
otheruise XF either does not fall ‘l ΟΔ·-

curve, and so we have our asser·
tion; or so far is it from mal<-
ing with FL an acute angle, that
now rather it must be supposed ,
to combine with LF in one
straight.

Accordingly from the point S let fall to the base AB
the perpendicular SP. This will be (from P. XXXIV.)
equal to LF.

But SP is (from Eu. Ι. 19) less than LS. Therefore
also LF is less than LS, and consequently much less than

· LX. Hence in triangle LXF the angle at point X will

be acute, because less ( from Eu. I. 18) than the angle
LFX supposed acute.

Now let fall to FX the perpendicular LT. This will fall
(because of Eu I. 17) toward the parts of each acute

angle. Wherefore point T will lie between points X,
and F.

T hen from the point T let fall to the base AB the
perpendicular TQ. LF will be (because of the right
