In the same way therefore Euclid ought not to be
blamed, because he defined parallel straight lines in this
manner, since he nowhere assumes them as given ior the
construction ol any problem, except aiter Prop. 31 oi the
First Book, in which as a problem he demonstratos, how
should be drowh from oyiven poihtwithoulopiven straight
line a straight line parallel lo this, and indeed according to

the definition ol parallels given by him, so that produced .

indeed into the infinite on neither side do they meet one
another. And what is more; he demonstrates this with-
, out any dependence from the postulate here controverted.
, Thus Euclid demonstrates without any petitio principii
that there coh be found in nature loro such straight lines,
which (lying in the same plane) protrocled on each side
into the infinite never meet, and therefore makes clearly
