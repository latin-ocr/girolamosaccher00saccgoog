COROLLARY 11.

Moreover it follows the interpretation should be the
same of the other Euclidean definition, in which he says
a suriace is plane, which lies evenly between its lines.

For if a surface inelosed by the aforesaid lines one
ADX straight, and another ABBX (whether this be a
⁸ simple or multiplex curved line, orbe composed of two

· or several straight lines, as suppose AB, BB, ΒΧ) if,
Ι say, a suriace [73] of this sort is supposed to be revolved
about the fixed straight ADX, until the line ABX comes
to congruence with the 'line ACX, located in the opposite
part, which assuredly is in every way equal and wholly
similar to ABX, and again with the same straight ADX
ineloses (toward the same part, whether upper or under)
a surface wholly equal‚ and similar to the aforesaid: one
· ot two things certainly happens3 either one su'rface fits
the other completely; or between those two suriaees is
inelosed a three-dimensional space.

And indeed ii the first happens, the suriace is called
plane; but if the second happens the surface is not called
plane; because then may be supposed other intermediate
surfaces‚ mutually equal, and similar, interposed between
the same extreme lines, which always mutually approach
more to each other without any certain limit, and there·

³ , fore even to the exclusion of every intermediate space.

But then each surfaee is called plane, because truly
it lies ex aequo between its extreme lines without any
ascent or descent into bordering parts.
