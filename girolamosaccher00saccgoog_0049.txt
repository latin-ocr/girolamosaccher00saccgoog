angle. And here begins a lengthy battle against
the hypothesis of acute angle, which alone op-
poses the truth of that axiom. [xiii] From pope 10 on.
4. And so in Propp. XV. and XVI. is proved
. that the hypothesis either of right angle, or ob-
tuse, or acute is established from any rectilineal
triangle whose three angles together are equal to,
or greater, or less than two right angles; and
in like way from any rectilineal quadrilateral‚
whose four angles are together equal to, or
greater, or less than four right angles. From pope 20 on.
5. Five other propositions follow, in which
are proved other indications for distinguishing
’ l the true hypothesis from the false. From pope 23 on
6. Now come four fundamental scholia. In
the last is exhibited a certain geometric figure,
of which Euclid perhaps thought, in order that
, his proposition might assume sels-evidence. In
the preceding three is shown that the prior en-
deavors of distinguished geometers have not
reached their aim. Since however the debated
axiom can be exactly proved from two straight
lines presupposed equidistunt, the author here
shows a manifest petitio principii to be con-
tained in that presupposition. If one wishes
e here to appeal to common persuasion, and surest
'experimen again he shows appeal should not
be taken to an experience involving an infinity
of points, when a single experiment pertaining
to any one point can suffice. In this place are set
forth by him three invincible physico-geometric
demonstrations. From pape 29 on.
