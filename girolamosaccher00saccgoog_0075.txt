perpendicular to AB, the point
H being within the angle XAB.

Pnoor. Assume in HC the portion Ac equal to BD,
and join (ΣΙ). CD will be, in the hypothesis of right
angle (P. ΙΙΙ.) equal to AB. Wherefore the angle ADB
will be equal (Eu. Ι. 8) to the angle DAC, or to its equal
(Eu. 1. 15) the angle XAH.

Quod erat primo loco demonstrandum.

Then, in the hypothesis of obtuse angle, CD will be
(P. ΙΙΙ.) less than ΑΒ.

Wherefore in the triangles ADB, DAC the angle
DAC, or its vertical XAH, will be (Eu. Ι. 25) less than
the angle ADB.

Quod erat secundo loco demonstrandum.

Finally, in the hypothesis of acute angle, CD will be
(P. III.) greater than the opposite ΑΒ. Whereiore in
the said triangle the angle DAC, or its vertical XAH, will
be (Eu. I.⁴ 25) greater than the angle ADB.

Quod erat tertio loco demonstrandum.

But inversely: if the angle cho, or its vertical XAH,
be equal to the internal and opposite ADB; the join CD
will be (Eu. Ι. 4) equal to AB, and therefore [11] the hy·
pothesis oi right angle will be (P. IV.) true.
