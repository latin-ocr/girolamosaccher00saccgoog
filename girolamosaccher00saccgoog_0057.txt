likewise CM, DM. Δ Δ
Because in this quadrilateral A Β

the angles A and B are taken
equal and likewise (from the
preceding proposition) the angles C, and D are equal; it
follows (Eu. 1. 4) (noting the equality of the sides) that
in the triangles CAM, DBM‚ the bases CM, DM will be
equal; and likewise, in the triangles ACH, BDH, the
bases AH, BH.

Therefore; comparing the triangles CHM, DHM‚
and in turn the triangles AMH, BMH; it follows (Eu.

Fig. 2.

Ι, 8) that we have mutually equal, and therefore right,
the angles at the points M, and H.
Quod erat demonstrandum.

perpendicular to any stroipht AB: I sap the join

at CD are right, or ob-
tuse, or acute.
