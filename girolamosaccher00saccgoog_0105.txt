COROLLARY.

Hence, any two opposite sides of the premised quadri-
lateral being produced toward the same parts, as suppose
AD to H, and BC to M; the two-extemal angles HDC,
MCD will be (Eu. Ι. 13) either equal to, or less, or
greater than the two internal and opposite angles together
at the points A, and B, according as is true the hypothesis
of right angle, or obtuse angle, or acute angle. ·

PROPOSITION XVII. ⁴

If the straight ΑΗ stands (fig. 15) ot right angles to
any certain arbitrorily wnall straight AB: l say thot
in the hypothesis of acute angle it cannot hold qood,

. that every straight BD, making with ΑΒ toward the
parts of this ΑΗ any acute angle

you choos'e, will at length meet K

this nH produced ot a finite, or k
terminated distance.

PRooe. Join ΗΒ. The angle ABH a ῃ

will be acute (Eu. Ι. 17) because of N
the right angle at the point A. Now δ

draw (Eu. 1. 23) HD toward 12⁴] the Α
parts of the point B, which not cut-
ting the angle ΑΗΒ makes with this ΗΒ an acute angle

equal to this acute angle ABH. Then from the point
B is let lall to HD the perpendicular BD, which will

fall toward the parts ol the aforesaid acute angle at the
point H.

Since therefore the side ΗΒ is opposite in the triangle
HDB to the right angle at D, and likewise in the triangle
