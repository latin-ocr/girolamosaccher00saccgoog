without any certain limit, approaches the other ever pro- ι

duced straight AX.

COROLLARY IIL

Whence finally follows, that not even at its infinite
production can ΒΧ be cut by that AX; because otherwise
from any paint of that AX beyond the aforesaid inter-
section a certain perpendicular ΖΜ could be supposed
let iall to AB produced3 whence again would follow that
ΒΧ (against the present hypothesis) met the aforesaid
AX not at an infinite, but wholly at a finite distance.

But this last dictum is beyond necessity. [57]

PROPOSITION XXVII.

I f a straiyht AX (fiy. 32) drawn at any however small
anple fram the point Α af AB, must at ienpth meet
(anyhaw at an infinite distance) any perpendicnlar
ΒΧ, which is supposed ereeted at any distance fram
this paint Α npan the secant AB: I say there will

then he na mare piace far the hypothesis af acute

Pnoor. From any point K chosen at will in AB near
the point A, the perpendicular KL is erected to AB,
‚ which certainly (from Cor. II. of the preceding propo-
sition) meets AX at a finite or terminated distance ia
