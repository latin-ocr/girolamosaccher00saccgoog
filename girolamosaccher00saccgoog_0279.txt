NOTES.

Paos 21. Prop. III: Euclid’s first two postulates are:
Let it be granted,

1. that one and only one sect can be drawn from any '
point to any other;

2. and that this sect may be produced continually on its
straight.

In Ι. 16 he assumes that the straight divides the plane
into two separate regions, and also the Archimedes assump-
tion that the straight is infinite and open. This block ol
assumptions is incompatible with the hypothesis ol obtuse
angle as Saccheri later shows. If it were also incompatible
with the hypothesis ol acute angle, we should have a perfect
case ot Saccheri’s lavorite method. The prools would be
fairy proofs leading to a direct demonstration ol their con-
tradictory opposite; and none of them could make part of a
modern treatise on non-Euclidean geometry.

But since Euclid's assumptions, barring the Parallel Pos-
tulate, are perfectly compatible with the hypothesis ol acute
angle, many of Saccheri's prools remain the most elegant
and cogent the world possesses in the domain of non- ,
Euclidean geometry. ’

Pnos 27. Prop. III, Cor. II: Saccheri simply cites this
corollary when, as often, he wishes the proposition: In any
birectangular quadrilateral HMPC with angle P obtuse and
angle C acute, side PM < CH.

To this the prool ol Prop. III, Part 3, applies.
