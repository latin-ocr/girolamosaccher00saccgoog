Philip Kelland, Cambridge Senior Wrangler, says: “It
is certain that from its completeness, unilonnity and fault·

lessness, from its arrangement and progressive character,
and from the universal adoption ol the completest and best
line oi argument, Euclid's Elements stands preeminently at
the head ol all human productione. In no science, in no
department ol knowledge, has anything appeared like this
work. For upward ol two thousand years it has commanded
the admiration oi mankind.''

For two millenniums Euclid's axioms and postulates re·

mained undoubted. Before Saccheri, no one had even ior ,

a moment thought of contradicting any ol them. But Sac-
cheri set forth two propositions, each a flat contradiction
ol Euclid's most famous postulate, the fifth (Heath), then
called Axiom 13 (Clavius), afterward Axiom 12 (Simeon),
and Axiom 11 (John Bolyai). These two new monsters,
hypotheses oi his own creating, he attacked.

Euclid from the beginning builds consciously upon the
assumption: Two points determine a straight. He also
uses the Archimedes assumption, and the assumption that
every straight, besides being unbounded, divides the plane
into two parts, is open, infinite. With the aid of these
assumptions, Saccheri disposes ol his first monster, the
hypothesis anguli obtusi.

It was not real death, however, but a magician's trance
that lasted more than a century. Finally freed from the
spell by the trumpet call of genius, it arises, a benignant

lairy, and to-day gives us Pure Spherics, deduced from a ’

set ol assumptione which give no parallels, no similar figures,
but double the value ol much ol our plane geometry by
interpreting it as spherics also, by showing how it holds good
as spherics, can be read off as spherica and used as spherica
also. Thus dralts from Euclid have become payable twice
over.

But apart from his Postulate V, all Euclid's assump·
tions, conscious and unconscious, fail Saccheri in his lengthy

battle, “diuturnum proelium adverm hypothesin anguli
