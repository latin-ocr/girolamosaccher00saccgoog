Says Heath: “‘Mill’s account of the true distinction be·
tween real and nomino! definitions had been fully antici-
pated by Saccheri.''

In his Lopica demonstrativo Saccheri lays down the
clear distinction between what he calls definitiones quid
nominis or nominales, and definitiones quid rei or r'eoles,
namely, that the former are only intended to explain the
meaning that is to be attached to a given term, whereas the
latter, besides declaring the meaning ol a word, affirm at
the same time the existence oi the thing defined or, in
geometry, the possibility oi constructing it. The definitio
quid nominis becomes a definitio quid rei “by means ol a
postulate, or when we come to the question whether the
thing exists and it is answered affinnatively.''²

Definitiones quid nominis are in themselves quite arbi·
trary, and neither require nor are capable oi prooi ; they
are merely provisional‚ and are only intended to be turned
as quickly as possible into definitiones quid rei, either

1. by means of a postulate in which it is asserted ot
conceded that what is defined exists or can be constructed,
e. g., in the case oi straight lines and circlos, to which
Euclid's first three postulates refer, or
¹ 2. by means ol a demonstration reducing the construc-
tion of the figure defined to the successive carrying-out of
a certain number oi those elementary constructions‚ the
possibility ol which is postulatori. Thus definitiones quid rci
are in general obtained as the result of a series of demon-
strations.

Saccheri gives as an instance the construction ol a square
in Euclid Ι. 46.

Suppose that it is objected that Euclid had no right to
define a square, as he does at the beginning oi the Book,
when it was not certain that such a figure exists; the ob
jection, he says, could only have force if, before proving
and making the construction, Euclid had assumed the afore-

postulatum vel dum venitur ad quaestionem on cst et respondetur
affirmative.” ibid.
