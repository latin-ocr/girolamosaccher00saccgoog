EUCLID'S ELEMENTS‚ BOOK IX, PROPOSITION 12.

lf there be horo mouy numbers soever iu continued propor-
tiou from uuity: Theu whatever prime numbers measure
the lost, the some uult also measure thot uext oster the
um‘t.

Let there be as many numbers as we please‚ A, Β, C, D
continual proportionals from unity3 I say whatever prime

· numbers measure D will measure A also.

Unity A B C D
,For example, 1 4 16 64 256
E H G F

2 8 32 128

For let some prime number E measure D; I say E
measures A.

For suppose it does not.

Now E is prime, and aprime number is prime to any it
does not measure [VII. 29]; therefore E, A are prime to
one another.

And since E mensures D, let it measure it by the units
in F ; therefore E multiplying F produces D.

Again‚ since A measures D by the units in C [IX. 11 and
Porism],⁶ therefore A multiplying C produces D. But E
has also by multiplying F made D; whence the product ot
A, C is equal to the product of E, F.

Therefore, as A to E, so is F to C [VII. 19].

But Α, Ε are prime; primes are also least [VII. 21]‚·
and the least measure those which have the same ratio the
same number oi times, the antecedent the antecedent and
the consequent the consequent [VII. 20] ; therefore E meas-
ures C.

Let it measure it by G; then E multiplying G produces
{brigg A has also by multiplying B made C [IX. ll 'and

⁸ x¹¹¹÷¹ = κ’ x'.
“‘Numbers prime to one another are the least oi those which
have the same ratio as they.''
