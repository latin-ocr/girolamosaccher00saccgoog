have the asserted case oi a common perpendicular, since
all angles at the points K are supposed right ; or all those
angles toward the parts of the point A are obtuse, and
therefore all therewith acute toward the parts oi the
point X, and so again Ι argue: Since in the quadrilateral
KDHK the angles at the points K are right, [46] but the
angle at the point D is acute, the side DK will be (from
Cor. ΙΙ. to P. ΙΙΙ.) greater than the side HK.

In a similar way the side HK is shown to be greater
than the side LK; and so always, comparing to each

other perpendiculars frorn any ever higher points of AX ·

let fall upon the other ΒΧ.

Wherefore AX, ΒΧ mutually approach each other
ever more toward the parts of the point X: which is the
second partos the disjunct proposition.

rrom an which rouows' that any two straights Ax,
ΒΧ, which are in the same plane, either have (even in
the hypothesis of acute angle) a common perpendicular.
or produced toward either the sarne part, unless some-¹

where at a finite distance one meets the other, mutually
approach each other ever more.
Quod erat etc.

COROLLARY 1.

Hence the angles toward the base AB will be always
obtuse at each point ol AX, irorn which is let fall a
perpendicular to the straight BX: will be, I say, always
obtuse, as those two AX, and ΒΧ mutually approach
each other ever more toward the parts of the points X;
which of course should be understood in a sane way, of
perpendiculars let fall before the mentioned meeting, ii

perchance one is to strike upon the other at a finite dis·
tance.
