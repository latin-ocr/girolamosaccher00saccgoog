But this standing, which in the last case was demon-¹

distinct points, or in one same point X infinitely distant.

But again, that this common perpendicular cannot be

cause otherwise (by Cor. ΙΙ. to Ρ. ΧΧΙΙΙ.) those straights
would thence begin mutually to separate, and so not meet
each other at an infinite distance; so that also (against
the express supposition) they would not mutually ap·

So they must have the common perpendicular in one
same point X infinitely distant. [⁶³]

PROPOSITION XXIX.

Resuminp fip. ³3 of the precedinp proposition: I say
every stroipht AC, which cuts anyle ΒΑΧ, finally
ot o finite, or terminated distance (even in the hy·
pothesis of acute anple) will meet ΒΧ in o certain

point P, if only Ac be produced ever more toward
the ports of the points X. ’

Puoos. And first indeed (lest straight AC include
space with AX) it must meet at finite distance the
straights LK, HK, DK in certain points C, N, M; must
meet, 1 say, unless before (and that at a finite distance,
just as we maintain) it meets BX in some point between
the point Β and one oi the points K. ¹

Then (from Cor. I. to Ρ. XXIII.) the angles ACK.
ANK, AMK will be obtuse.

Moreover those angles, always obtuse, approach
