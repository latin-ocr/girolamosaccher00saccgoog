But in so iar as may be here permissible to cite phys-
ical experimentation, I forthwith bring forward three
demonstrations physico-geometric to sanction the Euclid-
ean postulate.

Therewith Ι do not speak oi physical experimentation
extending into the infinite, and therefore impossible ior
us ; such as oi course would be requisite to the cognizing‚
that all points oi the straight join DC are equidistant
from the straight AB, which is supposed to be in the same
plane with this DC.

For a single individual case will be sufficient ior me;
as suppose, if, the straight DC being joined, and any one
point oi it N being assumed, the perpendicular NM let
fall to the underlying AB is ascertained to be equal to·
BD or AC. For then the angles on both sides at the
point N would be equal (Ρ. Ι.) to the angles correspond-
ing to them at the points C and D, which again (from
the same P. Ι.) would be equal inter se. Whereiore the
angles on both sides at the point N, and therefore also
the remaining two will be right.

Therefore we shall have a case ior the hypothesis oi
right angle; and consequently (by Propp. V. and XIII.)
we shall have demonstrated the Euclidean postulate. And
this may be the first demonstration physico-geometric.

I pass over to the second. Let there be a semi-circle,
oi which the center is D, and diameter AC. Ii ,then
(fig. 17) any point B is assumed in its circumference, to
which AB, CB joined are ascertained to contain a right
angle, this single case will be sufficient (as I have demon-
strated in Ρ. XVIII.) for establishing the hypothesis oi
right angle, and consequently ( from the aforesaid P.
’ΧΙΙΙ.) for demonstrating that famous postulate. [³⁶]

There remains the third demonstration physico-geo-
