ceding proposition) greater [52] than the four angles to·
’ gether of the quadrilateral KDHK‚ nearer to this base;
of which quadrilateral in the same way the four angles
together will be greater than the four angles together of
the quadrilateral KMDK subsequent toward this base.
’ And so always even to the last quadrilateral KNAB‚
whose four angles together assuredly will be the least,
in reference to the four angles together of each of the Ι
quadrilaterals ascending toward the points X.

But since are present as many quadrilaterals described
in the aforesaid manner, as are, except the base AB, per-
pendiculars let fall from points of AX to the straight
BX; the sum of all the angles together, which are com-
prehended in these quadrilaterals can be reckoned. We
assume that there are nine such perpendiculars let fall,
and therefore so nine quadrilaterals

We get (from Eu. I. 13) as equal to four rights the
angles comprehended hither and yon at the two points of
those eight perpendiculars, which lie in the middle be-
tween the base AB and the more remote perpendicular
LK. So the sum of all these angles will be 32 rights.

There remain two angles at the perpendicnlar LK, .
and two at the base ΑΒ. But the angles one indeed at the
point K and the other at the point B are supposed right;
but the angle at‘the point L (from the Cor. to P. XXIII.)
is obtuse. Wherefore (even neglecting the acute angle at
the point A) the snm of all the angles which are compre-
hended by these nine quadrilaterals exceeds 35 rights.
But hence follows that the four angles together of the

quadrilateral KHLK, more remote from the base lael<
less from four rights than the ninth part of one right; ¹
and that indeed even if an equal portion of the aforesaid
sum of all the angles pertained to each of those quad·
rilaterals.

Therefore less yet will be the occurring defect, since
