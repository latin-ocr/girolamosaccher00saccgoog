¹ viscera of the very hypothesis, as must be done for a
perfect refutation.

But I reply I used a triple means in P. XXXVII. for
demonstrating the mentioned equality.

And first, in the body of the proposition, I prove the

curve CKD, as born from the hypothesis of acute angle ¹

(and therefore always concave toward the side of the
straight AB) must be equal to it, and indeed by drawing
the argument from the tangents of the curve.

Then in two subsequent scholia‘of the proposition,
apart from any special hypothesis, twice again I demon·
strate the equality of the generated line CD with the
underlying straight line AB, of whatever kind the line
CD so generated is supposed to be. ἵ

But now; in so far as the curve CKD, as born [99]
from the hypothesis of acute angle, is judged to be proved
by the first method equal to the underlying straight line
AB, a manifest refutation anses, since from the same
hypothesis it is evidently proved greater. But if the
aforesaid equality is supposed shown in either of the two

other modes; not even then does the refutation cease ’

against the hypothesis of acute angle. The reason is;
because nothing forbids, that (ΖΙ) may be curved‚ and
'nevertheless may be equal to the straight AB, while yet
it may be always convex toward that side, and therefore
the straight joining the points C, and D may be less
¹ than the opposite base AB, as in the hypothesis of obtuse
Ι angle. But, it is wholly contradictory, if toward that
side it be always concave, and therefore the straight
joining the points C, and D be greater than the opposite
base AB, as in the hypothesis of acute angle.

And so has just now been stated in the scholion of
’ the preceding proposition.
Of course against the hypothesis of 'obtuse angle it
