So arises the first non-Euclidean geometry.

In his book, Euclid’s Parollel Post'ulote,² Dr. Withers is
another who yields to the temptation to suppose revealed
Saccheri's emotional life, where, on page 119, he says:

“We have seen that the former assumption [ocuti] wor- .

ried Saccheri very profoundly in his heroic efforts to ‘vindi-
cate Euclid’ It was not a logical but a psychological or
experiential difficulty which caused Saccheri to reject the

logical conclusions to which his own labors clearly and ·

inevitably pointed; and it was certainly the¹ same sort of
difficulty which caused the immediate rejection, by himself
and by subsequent mathematicians, ol the assumption [ob-
rusi].'’

Saccheri's volume' 1s divided rnto two Books. The first,
Propp. I-XXXIX, pp. 1-101, we give entire. The second, pp.
102-142, we omit. It considers two of Euclid's definitions,

Eu. V. del. 6, now numbered 5; and Eu. VI. def. 5, now ,

omitted. This “Liber Secundus’' isa defense of the pro-
found treatment of proportion in Euclid’s Book V. It shows
again Saccheri's wisdom‚ penetration and modemity.

Remembet Perry saying: “I wasted much precious time
of my life on thefifth book of Euclid‚ '' and then the dictum of
. the great Cayley,‘ ‘There rs hardly anything m mathematice
more beautiful than his wondrous fifth book.” For my own
pau, nothing ever better repaid study.

Ihthis reproduction, the original pages are identified by
their numbers rn square brackets. Saccheri's “Indicis loco”
refers to these. For quick orientation, however, a “Table
of Contents’' has been added, giving the location of any
particular proposition, scholion, corollary, etc, bytthe page·
numbers of this reprint.

Misprints of the original edition, both those noticed by

Saccheri’s printer and those overlooked, have been corrected
without further comment. ’

It is a piece of inestimable good fortune that the page
proofs have been read by one of the foremost classical
' scholars in America, Dr. M. W. Humphreys‚ who says:
