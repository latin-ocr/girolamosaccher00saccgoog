of ABBX, ACCX, pass over to the occupying of new and
new position, but on the contrary all the intermediate
points of ADDX remain in the same place.
Therefore it cannot be, that two lines straight in ’
accordance with the premised conception inclose a space.

Hence moreover follows we should admit the Euclid-
ean postulate: that from o given point to any assigned
point a straight line moy be drawn.

¹For it is clearly understood, that always two lines
without any certain limit can be drawn, terminated in the
aforesaid points A, and X, which mutually approach, and
therefore inclose less space, while indeed one is drawn
toward the left side, and the other of the same shape
toward the right, or one over, and the other under; I
say, lines of this sort may be drawn always mutually
approaching without any certain limit, which are com-
pletely of the same shape with each other, and therefore
mutually succeed each other when supposed revolved
about the fixed end points A, and X.

Whence clearly in like manner is understood, at
length (in ever greater approach of these like shaped
lines, one to the other) should follow the coalescence
into one, and the same line ADX, which cannot be· re-
volved about those lixed extreme points so as to occupy
a new position. And this will be the straight line postu· .
lated.

Where again is established to be unique the straight
line, which can be drawn from a given point to any other
assigned point.
