must meet this in some point L stationed between the
points A and M; else obviously (against Eu. Ι. 17) it
must cut either AB or MN perpendiculars to ΒΧ.

PROPOSITION XXV.

If two stroiphts (fig. 30) AX, ΒΧ existinp in the same
plane (standing upon AB, one indeed ot on acute
angle in the point A, and the other perpendiculor ot
the point B) so always approach more to each other
mutuollp, toward the ports of
the point X, thot devertic-
less their distance is olwops
preater than a certain os-
siyned length, the hypothesis
of acute angele is destroyed.

Pnoor. Let Rbe the assigned
length. If therefore in ΒΧ is as-
sumed a certain BK any chosen
multiple oi the proposed length
R; it follows (from the preceding
scholion) that the perpendicular erected from the point K
toward the parts of AX will meet it at some point L ; and
again (from the present hypothesis) it follows that this
KL will be greater than the aforesaid length R. Further·
more ΒΚ is understood divided into portions KK, each
equal to R, even until KB is itself equal to the length R.
Finally from the points K are erected to ΒΧ perpen-
diculars meeting AX in points L, H, D, M, even to the
point N nearest the point A.

Now I proceed thus.

The four angles together of the quadrilateral KHLK,
