Then says Dante of his asking,

Now what could Saccheri think? Let us remember the
authority of Euclid, the just reverence for his Elements.
He founds geometry upon certain assumptions on which the
whole of the reasoning rests. No alternative was presumed
possible. In 1731, two years before Saccheri’s publication,
in a book with almost the same title Α Defense of Euclid’s

Elements, Edmund Stone‚ F.R.S., calls it “a work whose
propositions have such an admirable connection and de
pendente, whose demonstrations are so convincing, elegant
and perspicuous‚ that it is beyond the skill of man to con-
trive better. This is the happy Empire wherein Truth has
had an uninterrupted reign for upward of two thousand
years, in profound peace.''

In The W undersul C entury, Alfred Russel Wallace says,
speaking of all time before the seventeenth century: “Then
going backward we can find nothing of the first rank except
Euclid’s wonderful system of geometry‚ perhaps the most
remarkable product of the earliest civilizations.''

Says Prof. Alfred Baker of the University of Toronto:
“Of the perfection of Euclid (B. C. 290) as a scientific “
treatise, of the marvel that such a work could have been
produced two thousand years ago, I shall not here delay
to speak.”

Says Clifford: “This book has been for nearly twenty-
two centuries the encouragement and guide of that scien-
tific thought which is one thing with the progress of man

, from a worse to a better state.”
