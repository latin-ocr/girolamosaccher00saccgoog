Here may be observed a notable difference from the
hypothesis of acute angle.

For in this the general concurrence of such straights

cannot be demonstrated, as often as any straight falling
upon two, makes two internal angles toward the same
parts less than two right angles; cannot, Ι say, be directly
demonstrated, even if in this hypothesis the aforesaid
¹ general concurrence be admitted, as often as one of the
two angles is right. · '
’ For although the straight AD be perpendicular even ·
to the straight AP; in which case it certainly could not
concur with another perpendicular PL (Eu 1. 17);
nevertheless the two angles together DAX, PXA, could
be less than two right angles, in accordance with the
aforesaid hypothesis, since in it the two angles together
PAX, PXA may be less (P. IX.) than one right angle.
But it was worth while to have observed this,

But how, solely from the general admission of con-
currence when one of the angles is right, and with an
assigned incident however small, the hypothesis of acute
angle can be demolished; this we shall show after the
’ next three propositions.

SCHOLION 11.

In the three preceding theorems Ι have studiously set
down this condition, that the cutting straight ΑΡ, or XA,
is understood to be of a designated length as preat os you
choose. ,

For if, without any determinate extent of the cutting
straight, it be discussed precisely concerning the exhibit-
ing and demonstrating of the concurrence of two straights
at the apex of a certain triangle, whose [¹8] angles at the
base are given (less indeed than two right angles) as,
