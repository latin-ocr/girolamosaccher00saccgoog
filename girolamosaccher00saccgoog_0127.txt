must be used for farther progress after the new definition
of parallels.

But behold this other postulate in Clavius (to whom
Borelli himself expressly refers) in the scholion after
Prop. 28 of the First Book: If a straight line, as sup
pose BD upon another straight, as suppose BA, moves
transversely making with it at its extremity B always
right angles, its other extremity D describes a linc also
straight DC, until this BD shall have come to congruence
with the other equal sect Ac. I acknowledge the fitness of
the postulate, that thence a transit may be made to demon·
strating that other Euclidean postulate, upon which cer-
tainly at length must be supported all remaining geom-
etry. For Clavius had previously declared; that a line, oi
which all points are equally distant from a certain as·
sumed straight AB; as assuredly is (from the hypothesis
of the aforesaid construction) the line DC; this line also
must be straight ; because certainly it will be of such sort,
that all its intermediate points lie exaequo (such is the
definition of a straight line) between its extreme points
D, and C ; lie ex aequa, say I, since all are equally distant
from this assumed straight ΑΒ, truly by as much as the
length is of this BD, or AC. In this place Clavius intro·
duces the example of the circular line, of which we shall
speak more conveniently below; where I shall show the
clearest disparity in this regard [³4] between the straight

‘line and circle.

But meanwhile I say it is not sufficiently evident‚
whether the line described by this point D is rather the
straight DC than a certain curve DGC either convertor
concave toward the side of this BA.

For ii from the point F bisecting this BA a perpen-
dicular is supposed erected, which meets the straight DC
in E, and the aforesaid curves in G, and G, it follows

surely (from P. ΙΙ.) that the angles at the point E will ἱ
