were at another time demonstrated, that the distance oi
the two AH, AD produced in infinitum goes out ever
greater beyond all finite assignable limit.

But that the aforesaid Clavius should have judged
the truth ot this assumption sufficient for demonstrating
the postulate here in question; that ought to be blamed
to the opinion preconceived by Clavius about equidistant
straight lines, which we may discuss more conveniently
, in a subsequent scholion. '

SCHOLION 11.

In wlrlclr isweiyhed an idea of thot brilliant mon Giovaum'
Alforuo Borelli lu his Euclides Restitutus.

This most learned author blames Euclid, because he
defines parallel straight lines to be those, which beina
r‘n the same plane do not meet on either side, even ἢ*
produced in infinitum.

He offers as ground for his accusation, that such
relation [32] is unknown: first, he says, because we are
ignorant, whether such infinite non-concurrent lines can
be found ln nature: tleen- also because we cannot perceive
tlte properties of tlte infinite, and hence a relation of tlric
sort is not clearly coynized.

But with reverence for so great a man it may be said:
Can Euclid be blamed, because (to bring forward one
among innumerabis examples) he defines aequare to be a
figure quadrilateral, equllateral, rectanyular3 when it may
be doubted, whether a figure of this sort has place in
nature? He could, say I, most justly have been blamed,
if, before as a problem demonstrating the construction, he
had assumed th'e aforesaid figure as given.

But that Euclid is free from this fault follows mani·
festly from this, that he nowhere assumes the square de-
fined by him, except after Prop. 46 of the First Book,
