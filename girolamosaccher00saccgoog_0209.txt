be considered demonstrated in P. XXVIII, as I point
out in its corollary. ’

Therelore it holds, that (in the hypothesis of acute
angle) there will be a certain determinate acute angle
BAX, drawn under which AX only at an infinite distance
meets [7⁰] ΒΧ, and thus is a limit in part from within,
in part from without; on the one hand oi all those which
under lesser acute angles meet the aforesaid ΒΧ ata
finite distance; on the other hand also oi the others which
under greater acute angles, even to a right angle inclusive,
have a common perpendicular in two distinct points
with ΒΧ. ‘ ·

PROPOSITION XXXIII.

The hypothesis of erute euple is absolutely falsa· become
repugnant to the norme of the straight line.

Pnoon. From the foregoing theorem may be estab-
lished, that at length the hypothesis ol acute angle inim-
ical to the Euclidean geometry has as outcome that we
must recognize two straights AX, ΒΧ, existing in the
same plane, which produced in infinitum toward the parts
ol the points X must run together at length into one and¹
the same straight line, truly receiving, at one and the
same infinitely distant point a common perpendicular in
the same plane with them.

But since Ι am here to go into the very first principles,
Ι shall diligently take care, that Ι omit nothing objected
almost too scrupulously, which indeed Ι recognize to be
opportune to the most exact demonstration.

LEMMA I.

Two stroipht lines do nol inclose o space.

Euclid defines a straight line as one which lies evewh·
between its points.
