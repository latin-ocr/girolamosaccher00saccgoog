joining point A with this higher point will make with
AB a greater angle than angle BAP.

And so ever without any intrinsic end.

Wherefore angle BAX (since indeed AX both always
approaches to ΒΧ, and meets it only at an infinite dis-
tance) will be the oatside limit of all acute angles under
which straights produced from that point A meet the
aforesaid ΒΧ at a finite distance.

PROPOSITION XXX.

To ana terminated straiyht ΑΒ stands at riyht anates
(fiq. 36) a certain unbounded straiyht ΒΧ . Ι sap
firstly, that the straiyht Ar, erected perpendicularlp

toward the sarne parts upon ΑΒ, will he one intrinsic
h'rnrt of all those straiqhts, which drawn from the

pointl651A out toward thesaure parts have (in the
hypothesis of acute anate) acommon perpendicular
in two distinet points with the other unbounded
straiqht ΒΧ. I sap secondlp, that no acute anate
will be the minimum of all, produced under which
astrat‘qht from the aforesaid point Α (in the afore·
said hypothesis) has in two distinct points a common
perpendicular with ΒΧ.

Paoos os THE Fnesa Pasa. For since AY has in
common at two distinet points Α and B the perpendicula
