lemma) the direct prolongation of any assumed simple .

straight AX cannot be understood to be other than the
one XD, which proceeds ex aequo on both sides in rela-
tion to theleit, and right side oi the aforesaid ΑΧ;
from which assuredly follows, that with AX fixed it can-
not, itself unchanged‚ have another position in this plane.

But that in the same plane a certain other XM can
be designated to the leit, splitting infinitely little from
XD, nothing avails. For again another, XF,'likewise to
the right could be designated, which just so splits in-
finitely little from the same XD. Wherefore (as in the
the lemma before cited) [82] alone AXD will be the
straight line defined by us. ·

The third finally is:' in this second lemma may be
judged immediately demonstrated Eu. XI. 1; that oi the
same straight one part cannot be in a lower plane, and
another in an upper.

LEMMA III.

, Is two straights AB, CXD meet each other (fig. 39) in

unp intermediote point X of theirs, they do not there
touch each other, but oue cuts the other there.

'Pboou Foris that were possible, the whole CXD
lies on one and the same side of AB. Join AC. Then
AC will not be the same with AXC

as if prolonged; because otherwise Λ κ
(against the preceding lemma) oi Γ 'rvr ὃ
two straights, one AXC, and the
other the assumed DXC, there
’ would be one and the same com-
mon segment XC.

And so join BC. Again this BC will not be a pro-
longation of BA to the point C; lest two straights, one

XAC, portion oi this ΒΑΕ, and the other XC inclose a
space, against the preceding Lemma I.
