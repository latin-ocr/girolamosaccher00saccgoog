Wherefore (Eu. Ι. 19) the join DA will be greater
than the join DS, and the join supposed equal to it DM.

Quod erat secundo loco demonstrandum. Itaque con·
stant proposita. [1³]

PROPOSITION XI.

Let the straight ΑΡ (es lonq as you choose) cut the two
straiyhts PL, AD (fiy. 9), the first indeed et riyht
anyles in P, but the latter at A in any acute anyle
converyiny toward the parts PL. I say the straiyhts ·
AD, PL (in the hypothesis of riyht angele) wilt ae
lenqth meet in some point, and indeed at a finite, or
terminated distance, if they ere prolonyed toward
those parts on which they make with the transversat
ΑΡ two enyles toyether less than two riyht anyles.

Peooe. Prolong DA toward the other parts even to
some point X, and through A ercet to ΑΡ the perpendic-
ular HAC, the point H being toward the parts of the
angle XAP. '

Then in AD produced toward the parts of PL assume
two equal intervals AD, DF, and let fall upon the trans·
versal ΑΡ the perpendiculars DB, FM, which certainly
(Eu. Ι. 17) fail toward the parts of the acut'e‘ angle DAP;
