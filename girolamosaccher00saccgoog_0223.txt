other way retain its arbitrary prolongation, while its part
XB is supposed to be transferred through new and new
positions even to fitting XC in that one plane, the portion
AX remaining meanwhile in the same place; Ι say it
cannot retain its chosen continuation, except in so far
as the portion XB is understood to ascend, or to descend
to be with the fixed AX in new, and new planes, until
it returns to the old plane, fitting there the aforesaid
XC. [77]

For this may. be adjudged already demonstrated ; be-
cause obviously no position in that same plane canhe found,
at which AXB (the portion AX remaining in its place)
retains its chosen prolongation, except where it comes to
congruence with the aforesaid AXC.

Ι say fourthly: in the arc BC such a point D can be

designated that, if XD be joined, then this AXD not only
f is a straight line, but moreover it lies s0‚ that the pro-
longation AXD, considered toward the left, is wholly
ἵ equal, or similar to the same prolongation considered

toward the right.
Pnoon. The first part (whatever be the point D

designated in the arc sc) is shown by the method used

above in regard to the prolongation AXM.
But the second part is proved thus. We suppose here

¹ two straights ΑΧΒ, AXC with the same common segment

AX. Further we suppose the prolongation AXB toward the

left not to be wholly similar, or equal to the same prolonga· ,

tion toward the right ; because, such a complete similitude
or equality holding good, it is easily shown that segment
Ax can be common to no other straight line, just as we
shall demonstrate of the prolongation AXD. Finally in

Ἴ consequence we suppose the prolongation AXB may so
