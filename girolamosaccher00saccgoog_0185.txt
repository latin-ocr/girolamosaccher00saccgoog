at another place (this standing) they can admit a com-

For then these two AX, ΒΧ mutually approach each
other ever more, indeed either within a certain deter-

And again this it is, that 1 promised at the end of
Scholion IV. after P. ΧΧΙ., as from the very terms
clearly appears.

SCHOLION III.
Moreover I could wish here to he observed the differ?

ence between this proposition and the preceding P. XVII.
For there (recall fig. 15) has been shown the destruction

of the hypothesis oi acute angle, if (the straight AB being
as small as you choose) every BD erected at whatever
acute angle, must at length meet in some point K the per-
pendicular AH produced.

But here (vice versa) in fact is permitted the desig-
nation of however most small an acute angle at the point
l A while still the sect AB to which is to be erected the in·

whatever. ’

PROPOSITION XXVIII.

If two straights AX, ΒΧ (produced from any-sized
straight AB toward the some ports, the first under
on acute angle, and the other perpendiculorly) mu·
