Take in DC the piece DK equal to BA, and join ΑΚ
Since therefore on BD stand perpendicular the equal
straights ΒΑ, DK, the angles ΒΑΚ, ona wnr be equor
(P. L). But this is absurd; since the angle BAK is by
construction less than the assumed right angle BAC; and -
the angle DKA is by construction external, and therefore
(Eu. Ι. 16) greater than the internal and opposite DCA,
which is supposed right. T herefore neither of the afore-
said straights, DC, BA, is greater than the other, whilst
the angles at the join (ΣΙ) are right; and therefore they
are mutually equal.

Pnoor or aaa Sacouo Pares. But if the angles at
the join CD are obtuse, bisect AB, and CD, in the points
M, and H, and join MH.

Since therefore on the straight ΜΗ stand perpendicu ·

lar (P. ΙΙ.) the two straights AM, CH, and at the j0in
AC is a right angle at A, the straight CH will not be
(P. Ι.) equal to this AM, since a right angle is lacking
at C. .

But neither will-it be greater: otherwise in HC the
piece KH being assumed equal to this AM, the angles at
the join AK will be (P. I.) equal.

But this is absurd, as above. For the angle MAK- is
less than a right; and the angle HKA is (Eu. Ι. 16)
greater than an obtuse, such as the internal and opposite
HCA is supposed.

It remains therefore, that CH, whilst the angles at the
join CD are taken obtuse, is less than this AM3 and
therefore CD double the former is less than AB double
the latter. · . ¹

angles at the join are acute, MH being constructed as be·
fore perpendicular (P. ΙΙ.), we proceed thus. Since on
