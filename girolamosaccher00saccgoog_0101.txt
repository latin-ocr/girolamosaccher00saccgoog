But finally. If the three angles of the proposed
triangle ABC are taken less than two right angles, now
of the two triangles ADB, CDB, all the angles together
will be less than four right angles, because of the two
additional right angles at the point D.

This holding good: now of neither of the said tri-
angles will the three angles together be equal to, or
greater than two right angles; for thus vice versa of the
other triangle the three angles together would be less
than two right angles.

Wherefore (P. IX.) from one triangle indeed would
be established the hypothesis either of right angle or of
obtuse angle, and from the other the hypothesis of acute
angle ; which is contrary to Pr'opp. V, VI, and VII.

Therefore the three angles together of either of the
aforesaid triangles will be less than two right angles ; and

, therefore (P. IX.) [22] is established the hypothesis of

acute angle.
Quod erat tertio loco demonstrandum.
Accordingly by any triangle ABC, of which the three

. angles are together equal to, or greater, or less than two

right angles, is established respectively the hypothesis of
right angle, or obtuse angle, or acute angle.
Quod erat propositum.

COROLLARY.

Hence, any one side of any proposed triangle being
produced, as suppose AB to H ; the external angle HBC
will be (Eu. I. 13) equal to, or less, or greater than the
remaining internal and opposite angles together at the

points A, and C, according as is true the hypothesis of

right angle, or obtuse angle, or acute angle. And in·
versely.
