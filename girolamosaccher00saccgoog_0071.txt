acase for the hypothesis ol right angle, which (Ρ. V.)
would leave no place for the hypothesis oi obtuse angle,
Therelore the angles at the join RX must be obtuse.

LK cannot be acute toward this AB; because thus it
would be greater than AB, and still more therefore
greater than the sect CD. But here would be found, as
above, a certain intennediate between CD less, and LK
greater than this AB ; an intermediate, Ι say, equal to AB .

would take away every place for the hypothesis ol obtuse
angle. =

Finally from this very. cause the angles at the join
LK cannot be right3 therefore they will be obtuse.

Therefore with the sarne base AB, the perpendiculars
being increased or diminished at will, the hypothesis of
obtuse angle will always persist.

But the same ought to be demonstrated for any as-
sumed base.

Let there be· chosen (fig. 6) for
base any one of the aforesaid perpen-
diculars‚ as ΒΧ suppose.

Let AB, RX be bisected in the C
points [9] M and H; and ΜΗ joined.
