linc, clearly is not thus perse congruent with the proper
definition of the straight line.

Wherefore to define two parallel straight lines under .
this relation of mutual equidistance is the fallacy, which
in my aforesaid Lupicu I call definitionis complexae, in
connection with which every advance toward attaining
truth absolutely such is ineffectual. ·

I see in addition there still remains one necessary ob-

servation.
- · For we all are willing to grant the line joining the
extreme points of all equal perpendiculars, which in the
same plane are erected toward the same parts from the
separate points of an underlying straight line AB, must
be both equal to the aforesaid ΑΒ, and moreover in itself
straight.

But I say with usis first, that it is equal; then how-
ever, that it is straight.

For since the single points of the straight AB may be
thought always to proceed uniformly upon those perpen-

diculars of theirs to forming at length that certain CD; ·

it should seem manifest, that the generated CD, of what·

, soever kind, is equal to AB ; but especially, if we consider .

the explicatior contained in Scholion II. after [1⁰1] P.
XXXVII, where this point is most clearly demonstrated.

But thereafter still remains a great difficulty in demon-
strating, that this same generated CD cannot be anything
” but a straight line. ¹And he'nce comes it Ι think, that from
a certain common conviction, for more facile progress,
they have preferred to prestune the line straight, that
thence they might show it equal to the base AB, and
afterward infer right angles at the join CD.

But Ι say preat difficulty: For first it was necessary

⁴ to consider three hypotheses about the angles at the

strulyht join CD, forsooth either right, if it be equal to
the base AB; or obtuse, if less; or acute, if greater. But
