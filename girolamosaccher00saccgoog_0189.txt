greater (even in the hypothesis ol acute angle) than
any assigned finite length, as for instance the aforesaid

Εἰς. ³4.

This standing ; assume in ΒΧ (fig. 35) a certain BT
equal to CN, and erect from the point T toward AX the

perpendicular TS, which obviously (from Scholion atter v

P. XXIV.) meets AX in a certain point S. Then irom
the point S let fall to AB the perpendicular SQ.

This falls (because oi Eu. I. 17) toward the parts of
the acute angle SAB between the points A and B. Again,
acute will be the angle QST in the quadrilateral QSTB,
since the remaining three angles are right; else (against
Propp. V. and VI.) we come upon the hypothesis either

¹ „of right angle or of obtuse angle.

Hence the straight SQ will be greater (from Cor. 1.
to P. ΙΙΙ.) than the straight BT, or CN; and again the
angle ASQ will be greater than the excess by which the
obtuse angle ΛΒΤ exceeds a right angle, and thus greater
than the angle MNC. Draw therefore a certain SF cut·
ting ΑΩ in F and making with SA an angle equal to
MNC. Theo from the point Α draw to SF produced
the perpendicular ΑΟ. The point O falls (from Eu.
1. 17) below the point F, since the angle AFS (by Eu.
Ι. 16) is obtuse.
