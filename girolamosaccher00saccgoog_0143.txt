say wholly similar; because I do not need the propor-
tionality of the sides about the equal angles, nay nor any

determinate measure of the sides Α ,
themselves. Merely therefore I
do not wish triangles mutually ΔΓ ΔΗ

equilateral, since then Eu. 1. 8 Β Δ
would alone suffice, without any ι
assumption. Β

So let the angles at the points Fig. 24, ’

Α, Β, C, be equal to the angles

at the points D, E, F; and let the side DE be less than
the side AB; and in AB is assumed the portion AG equal
to this DE, and likewise in AC the portion AH equal to
this DF. But that DF must be less than AC Ι will make
clear below. Then (GH joined) follows (from Eu. I. 4)
the angles at the points E, and Fwill be equal [⁴1] to AGH,
AHG. However since the just mentioned angles, together
with the others BGH, CHG, are equal (Eu. I. 13) to four

· right angles; likewise will be equal to four right angles

the angles at the points B, and C, together with these same
angles BGH, CHG. Therefore the four angles of the
quadrilateral BGHC will be together equal to four right
angles; and consequently (from P. XVI.) is established
the hypothesis oi right angle; and at the same time (from
’ Ρ. XIII.) the Euclidean postulate.

MoreoverI have supposed the side DF, or AH assumed

equal to it, to be less than the side AC. For ii it were ’

equal, and so the point H should fall upon the point C,
then the angle BCA would be equal (by hypothesis) to
the angle EFD, or GCA (which then it would become)
a part to the whole; which is absurd.

But it it were greater, and so the join GH should cut
BC itselt in some point, now the external angle ΑΕΒ
would be from the hypothesis equal (against Eu. 1. 16) to
