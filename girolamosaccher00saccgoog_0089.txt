PROPOSITION XIII.

If the straight ΧΑ (of desiynoted length however great)
meetiny troo stroiyhts AD, XL, makes with them
toward the some ports (fig. ll) interooi onylesXAD,
AXL less thon two right angles: I soy, these two
(even if neither of those onyies be a right angle)
ot length witi mutnoily meet in some point on tte

’ side toward those onyies, ond indeed ot o finite, or
terminated distance, if either hypothesis holds, of
' right onyie or of obtuse onyie.

Pnoos. For one ol the said angles, as AXL suppose,
will be acute.

Accordingly from the vertex of the other angle is
dropped the perpendicular ΑΡ on XL, which certainly

(because of Eu. Ι. 17) falls on theside of the acute angle
AXL. Since therefore in the triangle APX, right-angled
at P, the two acute angles PAX, ΡΧΑ, together are not
less (P. IX.) than a right angle, in either hypothesis, of
right angle, or of obtuse angle; il these two angles are
taken away from the sum ol the given angles the then
remaining angle PAD will be less than a right angle.
Consequently we will be in the case oi the two preceding
propositions, since it is obvious that one or the other
hypothesis holds, either oi right angle, or of obtuse angle.
Wherefore the straights AD, and PL, or XL, meet ’
in some point at a finite, or terminated distance on the
side noted, [17] as well under the one as under the other
mentioned hypothesis.
Quod erat demonstrandum.
