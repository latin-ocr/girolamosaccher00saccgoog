In which isweiphed the endeavor of theArob Nasiraddin,
and likewise tlte ideo of tlte illustriores John
Wallis upon the some affair.

This endeavor of the Arab Nasiraddin the above

eulogized John Wallis has published in the Latin language
with remarks added in opportune place.

However Nasiraddin requires two things to be con-
ceded to him in this affair.

The first is; that any two straight lines lying in the
same plane, upon which ever so many other straight lines
so strike, that they are always perpendicular to one indeed
of these, but always cut the other at unequal angles, truly
toward one part always under an acute angle, and toward
the other always under an obtuse angle; that, Ι say, the
, above-mentioned lines be supposed always more (as long
as they do not mutually cut) to approach each other toward
the side of those acute angles; and on the other hand
always more to recede from one another toward the parts
of the obtuse angles.

s But Ι indeed, if nothing else impedesNasiraddin, wil·
