cause they are too complex. I only say here at
length Ι have disproved the hostile hypothesis of
acute angle by a manifest falsity, since it must
lead to the recognition of two straight lines
which at one and the same point have in the
same plane a common perpendicular. That this
is contrary to the nature of the straight line is
proved by five lemmas, in which are contained
five fundamental axioms relating to the straight
line and circle, with their correlative postul-
lates. From pope 43 on.
8. The Second Part contains six proposi-
tions. Here, after investigating the nature (as-
suming the hypothesis of acute angle) of that
line which at all its points is equidistant from an
assumed straight line, it is shown in many ways
that it equals the base opposite, whence is in·
ferred the certain falsity of the aforesaid hy-
pothesis. Wherefore at length in the last propo-
sition, P. XXXIX, is exactly proved that famous
axiorn of Euclid, upon which (as everybody
knows) the whole of geometry rests. From pope 87 on.
9. The Second Book cannot conveniently be
divided into propositions, although at opportune
places are intercalated many most useful theo-
rems and problems. Nevertheless is worthy of
express mention a certain axiom‚ of which not
merely the truth is there demonstrated but also
the universal utility for all geometry‚ without
need of the other inelegant postulate supposably
inserted by commentators under the name of
iudom, whose use begins at Eu. V. 18. So
much for the First Part of this Book, in which
is defended Eu. V. def. 6. From pope 102 on.
