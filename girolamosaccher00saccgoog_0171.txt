the sum ol the four angles together oi this quadrilateral
KHLK was shown the greatest of all, in relation to [53]
the four angles together of the remaining quadrilaterals.

But again; in consequence oi the supposition upon

which this proposition proceeds so great a length of ΒΚ
can be· assumed, that as many quadrilaterals as we choose
may be made on bases KK, each equal to the assigned
length R.

Whereiore the deiect ol the four angles together of
this more remote quadrilateral KHLK from four rights
is shown ever less both than a hundredth and than a
thousandth, and thus under any assignable part oi a
right. Further however, LK and HK will be always (in
accordance with the aforesaid supposition) greater than
the designated length R. Thereiore if in KL and KH
are assumed KS and ΚΤ equal to KK or the length R;
ST being joined, the two angles together KST, KTS
will be greater, in hypothesis of acute angle, than the two
angles together (from Cor. to P. XVI.) at the points H
and L in the quadrilateral THLS, or the quadrilateral
KHLK; and therefore (the common right angles at the
points K, K being added) the four angles together oi
the quadrilateral KTSK will be greater than the four
angles together of that quadrilateral KHLK

But now, since on one hand is stable and given the
quadrilateral KTSK, inasmuch as constant in the given
base KK, which indeed is taken equal to the assigned
length R, and again constant in the two perpendiculars
TK, SK equal to this base, and finally in the joining TS,
which comes out completely determinate; and on the
'other hand the four angles together of this stable and
given quadrilateral have now been shown greater than the
four angles together of the quadrilateral KHLK distant
as far as we choose from the base AB; assuredly it fol·
lows that the four angles together oi this stable and given
