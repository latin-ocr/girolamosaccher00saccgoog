attempted its demonstration from those propositions of
Euclid’s First Book alone which precede the twenty·
ninth, wherein begins the use oi the controverted propo·
sition. [x]

But again, since the endeavors oi the ancients in this
matter do not seem to attain the goal, so it has happened
that many distinguished geometers oi ensuing times, at-
tacking the same idea, have thought necessary a new
definition oi parallels. Thus, while Euclid defines paral-
lels as straight lines lyinp in the some plone, which, is

, infinitcly produced toward both sides, nowhere meet, they

substitute ior the last words oi the given definition these
others: always equidistont from each othcr3 so that all
perpendiculars from any points on one oi them let fall
upon the other are equal to one another.

But again here arises a new fissure. For some, and
these surely the keenest‚ endeavor to demonstrate the
existence oi parallel straight lines as so defined, whence
they go up to the prooi oi the debated proposition as
stated in Euclid's terms, upon which truly from that
twenty-ninth oi Euclid’s First Book (with some very
few exceptions) all geometry rests. But others (not
without gross sin against rigorous logie) assume such
parallel straight lines forsooth equidistont as ii given,
that thence they may go up to what remains to be proved.

And this is enough to indicate to the reader what will
be the material oi the First Book oi this work oi mine:
for a more complete explication oi all that has been said
will be given in the scholia after the twenty-first propo·
sition of this Book. '

Ι divide this Book into two parts. In the First Part
I will imitate the antique geometers, and not trouble my·
seli about the nature or the name of that line which at
all its points is equidistant from a certain line supposed
straight; but merely undertake without any petitio ptin-
