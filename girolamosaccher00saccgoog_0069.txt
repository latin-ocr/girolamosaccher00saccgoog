Therefore is established that ii even in a single case

PROPOSITION VI.

If even in a single ease the hypothesis of obtuse onyle
is true, always in every case it alone is true.

Proor. Let the join CD (fig. 5) make obtuse angles
with any two equal perpendiculars AC,
BD, standing upon any straight ΑΒ. ²

CD will be (P. III.) less than this 3

Assume in Ac and BD produced c
any two mutually equal portions CR
[8] and DX ; and join RX.

Now Ι investigate the angles at the a
join RX, which certainly (Ρ. Ι.) will Fiss· ⁵·
be mutually equal.

Il they are obtuse we have our assertion.

But they are not right ;1 because thus we would have
a case for the hypothesis ,of right angle, which (Ρ. V.)
would leave no place for the hypothesis of obtuse angle.
But neither are they acute.

For thus RX would be (P. ΙΙΙ.) greater than this
AB; and still inore therefore greater than CD itself. But
that this cannot be is thus shown. If the quadrilateral
CDXR is taken to be filled up by straights cutting off
from these CR, DX, portions mutually equal, this implies
transition from the sect CD, which is less than AB itself‚
to RX greater than it, verily transition through a certain
