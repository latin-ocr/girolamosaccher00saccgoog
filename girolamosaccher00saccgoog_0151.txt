PRooF. For ii AB, CD are equal, it follows (from
Ρ. ΙΙ.) that the straight LK, by which these two AC and
BD are bisected, will be to them a common perpendicular.
But if· either be the greater, as suppose AB; let fall to ·
BD (according to Eu. Ι. 12) from any point L ol AC
the perpendicular LK, meeting the other BD in K.

But it will meet it in some point K existing between
the points B and D; otherwise (contrary to Eu. Ι. 17)
the perpendicular LK would cut either AB, or CD, per-
pendicular to the same BD. If then the angles at the

point L are not right, one of them will be acute and the

, other obtuse.

Let the obtuse be toward the point C. But now LK
is understood so to proceed toward ΑΒ, that it always
stands at right angles to BD, and likewise opportunely
increased‚ or diminished, in some point of it cuts the
straight AC. It follows that the angles at the intersection
points with AC cannot all be obtuse toward the parts of
the point C, lest at length in that point Α, where the
straight LK is congruent with the straight AB, the angle
at the point A toward the parts of the point C should be
obtuse, when toward these parts it is by hypothesis acute.

Since therefore the angle at the point L of this LK .
is by hypothesis obtuse toward the parts of the point C,

’ the straight LK will not change over in this motion sd as

to make in some point of it with the straight AC an angle
acute toward the parts ol the aforesaid point C, unless
previously it changes over so as to make in some point of it
with this AC an angle right toward the parts of this same
point C.

Therefore between the points A, and L will be some
one intermediate point H, in which HK perpendicular to
this BD is also perpendicular to the other AC.

, In a similar manner is shown to be present a certain
XK between LK, CD, which is perpendicular both to the
