opposite base AB.

And that is what I had undertaken again to demon·
strate by this new method.

SCHOLION II.

But again: since the straight BA is discerned as suc·
cessively described by the points ot the semicircumierence
BLD by that motion always uniform and continuous; to
which description corresponds the description of that line
DKC by the diametrically correlative points oi the other
semicircumference BHD: it is easy to understand, that
this straight BA by that motion always uniform, and con·
tinuous is described by the one point B, which oi course
(as if unrolled) is thought always to run out with that
semicircumference upon BA; whilst meanwhile in exactly
the same time, by the same motion always uniionn, and
continuous, is described that other DKC by the othe'r one
diametrically correlative point D, which again itseli (as
if unrolled) is thought with its other semicircumierence
BHD always to run out upon the aforesaid DKC.

But then is more easily understood the asserted equal-
ity between DKC, and the straight BA opposite it; since
the two are imagined to be described in equal time, and
equal motion by two exactly equal points, or, if you pre·
fer, infinitesimals. ’ ’

Where it holds that this exact equality oi the aforesaid
points is not necessary for me in that new considera·
