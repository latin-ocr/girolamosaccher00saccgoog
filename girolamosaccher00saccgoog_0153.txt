straight BD, and [45] to the straight AC, if namely an
angle at the point L is assumed to be obtuse toward the
parts of the point A.

It follows therefore that the straights AC, BD, will
have a common perpendicular, and indeed within the
limits fixed by the designated points A, and C, when the
joins AB, CD exist in the same plane and are perpen-
dicular to BD.

PROPOSITION XXIII.

If any two straights AX, ΒΧ (pp. 27) are in the same
plana· either they have (even ih the hypothesis of
acute angle) a common perpendiculum or prolongari
toward either the same port, unless somewhere at a
finite distance one meets the other, they mutually

· , approach ever more toward each other.

PRoos. From any point A of AX let fall to the
straight ΒΧ the perpendicular AB. if BA makes with
AX a right angle, we have the as-
serted case of a common perpendicu-
lar. But otherwise this straight makes
toward one or the other part, as sup
pose toward the parts of the point X,
an acute angle. Accordingly in the
aforesaid straight AX between the
points A and X any points D, H, L Α .
are designated, from which are let fall ΡΨ· ²⁷
to the straight ΒΧ the perpendiculars DK, HK, LK

If any one angle at the points D, H, L be acute toward
the parts of the point A, it follows (from the preceding)
that AX, ΒΧ will have a common perpendicular.

But if every angle of this sort be greater than acute;
either some one will be right, and thus again we shall
