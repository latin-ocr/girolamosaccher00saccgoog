from the point A through X toward B) cannot have two
’ different positions in the same plane, in both of which
the portion indeed AX persists in the same place, but the
other portion XB in one ol those two positions fits (for
example) XC, and in the other position fits XM.

Of course I do not here deny, that the portion XB, if
it is supposed to be moved in its plane about the point X,
so that successively it fits exactly (from the preceding
lemma) not merely XM, XC, but also exactly fits [75]
the other infinitely many straights, which from the point
X may be drawn to the remaining intermediate points of
the arc BC: I say, I do not here deny, that XB in any ol
its positions may be considered as the continuation in a
straight of that fixed AX; when rather I have demon·
strated already about AXM that this would happen in
case of the hypothesis of a common segrnent: Solely
therefore I here affirm, in one merely of those new posi·
tions, as suppose while it fits XC, may be retained by it
the same arbitrary continuation, which rt has rn the first
position, where from the point A rt goes out through X
toward the pointB. '

And this indeed rs demonstrated thus. For first 1t is
evident that the continuation AXB cannot be wholly.
similar, or equal to the continuation AXC, if each is
considered toward the same part whether left or right;
because otherwise in such position AXB, AXC must
mutually coincide ; which is against the hypothesis of that
common segment AX: Ι say, must coincide; provided
that of course, in relation to the same fixed AX, the con·
tinuations XB, and XC in the plane concerned extend

¹ just similarly toward the same part whether left or right.

Secondly is evident that nothing prevents the aforesaid

s continuation AXB, considered toward one part, as suppose,

toward the left, being precisely similar, or equal to the
continuation AXC, considered toward the opposite part,
