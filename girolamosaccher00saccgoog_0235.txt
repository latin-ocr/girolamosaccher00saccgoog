..Ϊῇ · Therefore this BC either will cut XD (or the as-
f' ji· sumed straight DXC) in some point L; and then again
J two straight lines, one LC, portion of this BC, and the

other LXC‚ portion of the aforesaid DXC, inclose a
space; or one of the extreme points whether A of BA,
or D oi CXD, is inclosed within the space bounded by
CX, XB, and either BFC, or BHC.

But in either case the same absurdity follows: For
whether BA produced through Astrikes BFC in a point ’
F; or CXD produced through D striltes BHC in a point
H; always we come upon the same absurdity, that two
straights inclose a space; forsooth either the straightt8³l
BF portion of BFC together with the other BAF ; or the
straight HC, portion of BHC, together with the other
assumed straight prolonged CXDH.

Furthermore the same, or a greater absurdity fol-
lows if BA produced through A meets in any point
either CX, or its own serf in any point oi its portion XB.

And this likewise holds, if the other CXD produced
through D meets in any point either XB, or its own seli
in any point oi its portion CX.

Therefore is established, that two straights AB, CXD
meeting each other in any interrnediate point X of theirs,
do not there touch each other, but one will cut the other
there.

LEMMA IV.

Every diameter bisects its circle, ond the circumference
of it.

Pauor. Let there he a circle (recall fig. 23) MDH·
NKM, A its center, and MN a diameter. Oi this circle
the portion MNKM is thought so to revolve about the
fixed points M, and N, that at length it is superimposed

upon, or applied to the remaining portion MNHDM.
