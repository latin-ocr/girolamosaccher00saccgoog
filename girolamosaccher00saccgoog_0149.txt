would be in this way common. But this is evidently
repugnant to the natureof the straight line.

But if to any one may seem less opportune the obtuse
angle at the point X toward the parts of the point A, it
may easily be supposed right3 so that indeed (in the

motion of the aforesaid ΧΥ at angles always right above Ι

the straight AZ) more manifestly may appear that the
single points of that ΧΥ are always ruoved uniformly
relatively to the basal AZ; and therefore the aforesaid
XY cannot go over from a secant into a non-secant of the
other indefinite AY, unless either once in some point it
precisely touches it, or meets it in some point P, where
it has with this AY a common segrnent PY3 each of
which I'shall show contrary to the nature of the straight
line in Ρ. ΧΧΧΙΙΙ.

Thereiore in accordance with the true idea of the
straight line, must that XY, however great the distance
of the point X from the point' A, always meet in some
point this AY. And that this indeed (however srnall is
supposed the acute angle at the point Α) is sufficient for

demonstrating, against the hypothesis oi acute angle, the
Euclidean postulate, will follow from P. XXVII.

PROPOSITION XXII.

I f two straights ΑΒ, C D existinp in the same plane stand
perpendicular to a certain straight BD; but Ac join-
inp these perpendiculum makes
with them infernal acute auples η
(in hypothesis of acute onple): r

noted straights AC, BD havea Δ ς
common perpendicular, and itt-v Fls· 26· ψ
