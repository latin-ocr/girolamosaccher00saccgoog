be right, whatever line DC is understood at length as
described in this motion by the point D; and moreover
(from an easily understood superposition) the angles at
the points G willbe equal according as the one or the
other curve DGC may be described.

But agaim any point M in AB being assumed; if a
perpendicular is erected, which meets the straight DC in
N, and the aforesaid curves in H and H, I shall prove a
little later that the angles on both sides at the point N
will be right, in so far indeed as this straight DC is sup-
posed generated by the point D in that motion of its, or
in as far as the straight MN is decided equal to this BD.

But if one or the other curve DHC is supposed gen-
erated; from the like aforesaid easy superposition will
be demonstrated that again the angles MHD, MHC on
both sides will be equal‚ wherever in the one or the other
described curve the point H may be assumed, from
which to the underlying straight line AB the perpendicu-
lar HM is understood as let fall. But ol this thing more
fully and more scrupulously in the Second Part of this
Book, where it has its proper place.

To what end therefore, will you say, this untimely
anticipation?

To this end, say Ι; lest from this indubitable property
of the line generated in'this manner, proved by me most
rigorously in the aforesaid place; and indeed beyond any
defect of any sort infinitely small; we may decide pre·
cipitately that the line can be only the straight. ⁵

l Obviously the nature of the straight line must here be
investigated more profoundly, without which geometry

- scarcely grown beyond infancy [35] must there remain.
Therefore in this affair cannot be blamed a certain greater

’ investigation of a most exact verity.
Nor yet do I here deny, but that by some most ac·
curate physical experimentation may be discovered, that
