Postulate. Here then is something worthy of Saccheri’s
steel. To prove it from its own denial!

This would show that Euclid's assumptions‚ though com-
patible, were not all independent. On the other hand, the
independence ol the Parallel Postulate from the other as-
sumptione would be established ii it were shown to be in-
demonstrable irom them even with the help ol its own con-
tradictory opposite, that is, even by means ol Saccheri’s.
darling type, IX—12.

To get this negative in convenient form, Saccheri uses
lor it an equivalent‚ employing a figure found in his Clavius,
1574, and again in GiordanoVitale da Bitonto, in his Euclide
restituto onero 912· antichi elementi geometrici ristournti, a
facilitati. Libri XV. Roma. fol, 1680; and in both works pre·
cisely in discussion oi this very matter. The figure is the
isosceles bi-rectangular quadrilateral, Its other two angles
are equal. To assume one right is, with Euclid's other as·
sumptions‚ equivalent to the parallel postulate, whose nega·
tive therelore is to assume one oblique. Armed then with
this torm of its denial as an addition to the other Euclidean
assumptione, Saccheri sallies forth to the frey, steeled ior

. victory or defeat—but not lor the wholly unexpected and to

him inexplicable compound of victory and defeat which he
met. =
His negation breaks into two equal parts. The angle
assumed oblique is either obtuse or acute. Il it be obtuse,
he easily achieves his accustomed victory: he proves the
Parallel Postulate. Il it be acute, this twin will not win.

Why? We know. Saccheri never did.

Besides the Archimedes assumption, Euclid‚ and every
one else for more than a century after Saccheri, assumes
that the straight line is of infinite length. These assumptione
nulliiy the possibility of a pair of obtuse angles in a bi-
rectangular isosceles quadrilateral, and to that extent prove
the “hypothesis of right angle,” which is then equivalent to
the Parallel Postulate. But they are no obstacle to this pair
ol angles being acute.

Had there been some other unconscious assumption oi
