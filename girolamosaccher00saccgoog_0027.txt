by Saccheri under the name oi fallaciae duplicis hypothesis
are precisely those which consist in believing that conse·
quences worth considering can be deduced irom systems oi
hypotheses incompatible with one another (to wit, such
that among them are some whose negation can be deduced
from the others) ; and oi such he passes in review various
types, beginning with the simplest, namely, that oi a syllo-
gism whose premises directly contradict one another, and
going on to the more complicated cases in which the contra·
diction can be revealed only by the successive development
oi the consequences oi the system oi hypotheses, or postu·
lates, assumed as basis oi the entire matter.

In the investigation oi the independence oi postulates the
method consists in finding a case or a particular interpre-
tation in which the proposition we wish to prove not dedu·
cible from others given, ceases to be true while all the others
remain true. li such is found, we conclude that the propo-
sition cannot be deduced from these others, else it would be
true whenever they were,

This use and construction oi examples to show the
independence oi a certain proposition from others given
has oi late assumed the importance oi an ordinary and
indispensable procedure in the strictly rigorous elaboration
oi any deductive theory (in America, Robert L. Moore,
Huntington,'Veblen, and others). But Saccheri was the
first to use this procedure, and constructs his example with·
out leaving the field of formal logie. Ii his treatment oi
his “hypothesis oi acute angle’' is another case, it is the most
marvelous in the world.

In his Opus de proportionibus (lib. V, prop. 201),⁸
Cardan (bornat Pavia, 1501), to prove that two sides oi
a certain triangle he has occasion to consider are greater
than a certain arc oi a circle comprised between them, adopts

a peculiar reasoning and vaunts himself oi this singular
procedure as an extraordinary discovery oi his own:
