Let there be therefore (fig. 37) any line AX, which
from the point A through any intermediate points of it
runs consecutively even to the point X. This line is not
[71] called straight, if it be such, that it can be turned
about its two end points into another region, as suppose
from the left region into the right: Ι say it is not called
a straight line; because it will not lie exaequo between
its designated extreme points; since either it will lean
toward the left side, where from the point A
it runs out to the point X through certain inter-
mediate points B; or it bends to the right,
where from the same fixed point A it runs out ‘

l y to the same fixed point X through certain

intennediate points C which are wholly dir·

ferent from the aforesaid points B. Obviously

only that line AX can be called straight, which Figi37.
runs out from the point A to the point X

through such intennediate points D, as, in order one
after another continued, cannot be revolved‚ about those
fixed extreme points A, and X, to occupying new and
new location.

But in this idea of the straight line is contained mani·
festly the announced truth‚ namely that two straight lines
do not inclose a space. For if two lines are shown in-
closing a space, which have in common the two extreme
points A, and X, it is easily shown either that neither,
or only one of them is straight. Neither will be straight,
as for example ABBX, and ACCX, if it be supposed so
that they can be revolved about two fixed extreme points
A, and X, that their remaining intermediate points pass
over to occupying new and new place.

One only will be straight, as for example ADDX, if
about those fixed end points we may suppose ΑΒΒΧ.
ACCX, which on both sides with that ADDX inclose a

space, so to be revolved‚ that indeed the intermediate points
