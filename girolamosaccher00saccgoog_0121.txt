may not the same be said of the two assumed straight
lines AH, AD, unless a special reason constrains to the
contrary?

Nor here can Clavius be blamed that he opposes to .

Proclus this property oi the Conchoid‚ which cannot be
demonstrated except with the aid of many theorems rest·
ing upon the here controverted postulate.

For I say from this itself the force of the Clavian
rebuttal is confirmed; because it is certain, this postulate
being assumed, it manifestly follows, that two lines in
infinitum protracted, one straight and the other curved.
can recede one from the other ever more within a certain
finite determinate limit; whence at any rate may arise a
suspicion lest the same may happen for two straight
lines, unless ,otherwise demonstrated.

But it is not therefore possible, when I now have made
manifest in the corollary to the preceding [31] proposition
the absolute truth of the aforesaid assumption, imme-
diately to go over to the assertion of the Euclidean pos·
tulate.

For previously must also be demonstratas, that those
two straights AH, BC, which with the transversal AB
make two angles toward the same parts equal to two
right angles, as for example each a right angle, do not
also, protracted toward these parts in infinitum, always
separate more from one another beyond all finite assign-
able distance.

For if one chooses to presume the affirmative, which
is indeed entirely true in the hypothesis of acute angle;
it certainly will not be a legitimate consequence, that a
straight AD in any way cutting the angle HAB, hence
of course making at the same time two internal angles
DAB, CBA toward the same parts less than two right
angles3 that, I say, this straight AD, produced in infini-
tum, must at length meet with BC produced; even if it
