parture, none the less do we likewise arrive at the eon-
elusion that the proposition in question is true.

In this process we reaeh nothing absurd or false, but
thus proceeding we attain the very proposition which was
to be proved, so that in this way it shows itself as a eon·
sequence of its own negation!

In his preiaee, Saccheri, enumerating the parts of his
work in 'which he believes himself to have made new and
important contributions to the ordinary treatment oi logie,
gives first place to Chapter ll of Part I, devoted preeisely
to this type of reasoningf He might still claim the merit
of being not only the first but the only one to employ this
method 1n a systematic treatise on logie. To have applied
gto the elaboration of the rules ol the‘s'cholastic logie,
Saccheri regards as one of the most important ameliorations
introduced by himin the treatment of the subject, and lor
us it is highly significant to ηοω-Ἦ the greatest advantage
inherent m this innovation of h1s consists lor him ιη his
being able by this means to render his exposition indepen-
dent of the assumption of a certain postulate he believes
indispensable if the ordinary treatment be followed.

Hence there 1s an exact correspondenee between the
. use he makes rn his Lopica of this demonstrative procedure,
and the use he afterward attempted to make of it in his
Euclides vindicatus, aiming to obviate the necessity of as-
suming the Parallel Postulate.

Vallati, of whose few preeious pages we avail ourselves,
points out that Saccheri tells how already in his youth he
arrived at the idea that the characteristic property of the
most fundamental propositions‚ in every demonstrative sei-
enee, was preeisely their being indemonstrable except by
reeourse to this IX—12 type of argumentation (see Eu.
vind„ pp. 99-100), and then adds:

“It was in hopes of reaching m this way a prooi of the
Parallel Postulate, namely, dedueing it from the very hy-
pothesis ofits t,falsity that Saccheri pushed on in the in-
