corresponding parts, oi which it is certain they are equal
to each other.
Now for the prooi of the proposition.

Suppose erected from the base AB to the curve CKD
(fig. 45) indefinitely many perpendiculars NF, LF, PF,
MK, TF, VF, IF; and on the base AB take as equal the
portions AN, NL, LP, PM, MT, TV, VI, IB.

First is certain the angle oi 'AC with the curve will
be equal to each voi the angles of the aforesaid perpen-
diculars with the curve on either side at the points F, or
at the point K, or at the point D. For if the mixed
quadrilatera] [⁹1] ANFC is supposed to be superposed
upon the mixed quadrilateral NLFF, the base AN lying
upon the equal base NL, Ac falls upon NF, and NF
upon LF, because oi the equal right angles at the points
A, N, L. Then because oi the equality (from P.
XXXIV.) oi the straights'AC, NF, LF, the point C falls
upon point F of NF, and this upon the other point F
oi LF. “

Moreover the curve CF exactly fits the curve FF:
for ii one oi these, as CF fell within or without; any
point Q being assumed between points N, and L, and the
perpendicular being drawn cutting one curve in X, and
the other in S, QX, QS would be equai (from the known ,
nature oi this curve), which is absurd. The same will
hold, if in the said superposition the straight NF remains
in its place, and the straight Ac falls upon LF. Again
