continuity. An elementary prool without this and without
the Archimedes assumption is given by Bonola.

Without these, and with only a sect-carrier replacing the
circle in constructions, Euclid's geometry and a geometry
iulfilling the hypothesis oi obtuse angle are given in Halsted,
Gbome'trie rationnelle, Paris, Gauthier-Villars. Compare, ior
the hypothesis oi acute angle: John Bolyai‚ The Science
Absolute of Spoce, translated irom the Latin by Dr. George
Bruce Halsted ; and Nicholas bobachevski, Geometricol Re-
seorches on the Theory of Parollels, translated from the
original by George Bruce Halsted (The Open Court Pub
lishing Company, 1914).

to be right, Euclidean geometry is established. But measure
ment being imperfect, this is hopeless. What it such angle
were iound other than right by a difference greater than the
limits oi experimental error?

Paos 109. Prop. XXI. Scholion IV: Saccheri misses
the possibility that the intersection point P oi APY and
XPY may go to infinity while AX remains finite.

Pasa 192. Ly is a term oi the grammarians and rhetori-
cians, by which is denoted the treatment oi a word as itsett
a thing. The Greek article τὸ was thus used.
