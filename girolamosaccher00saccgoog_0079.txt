since with this (Eu. I. 13) 1121 the angle XAH makes
up two. Wherefore, subtracting the right angle ΗΑΒ,
the angles ADB and BAD will be together less than one
right angle.

Quod erat tertium.

PROPOSITION K

If the straight ΠΒ (fip. 8) stand perpendiculor to u
straipht ABM, and the join ΠΜ be preater than the
join DA, then also the bose ΒΜ will be preater than
the bose ΒΑ. And inverselp.

Pnoor. And in the first place assuredly these bases
will not be mutually equal. Otherwise (Eu. Ι. 4) AD
and DM would be equal‚ contrary to the hypothesis.

But neither will BA be greater than ΒΜ. Otherwise,
in BA the portion BS being taken equal to ΒΜ, and SD
joined, the angles BSD, BMD (Eu. Ι. 4) would be equal.
But angle BSD is (Eu. 1. 16) greater than angle BAD.
Thereiore angle BMD would be greater than angle BAD.
But this is contrary to Eu. 1. 18; since side DM in triangle
MDA is supposed greater than side DA. It remains
therefore, that the base ΒΜ is greater than the base BA.
, Quod erat primo loco demonstrandum.

Next if either base, as BA suppose (the figure need
not be changed) is conceived as greater than the other
ΒΜ; then the join DS, which cuts off from BA the por-
tion SB equal to ΒΜ, will be equal (Eu. I. 4) to the
join DM. Again angle DSA will be obtuse (Eu. Ι. 16)
and angle DAS acute (Eu. Ι. 17).
