surd in the hypothesis of acute angle3 since the straight

KH joining equal perpendiculars KC, HD, makes¹ acute
angles with these perpendiculars.

Therefore the perpendicular BD is not (in the hypoth-
esis of acute angle) greater than the half of the perpen-
dicular MC.

Quod erat demonstrandum.

PROPOSITION XXI.

The sume remaininp: I f AM aud Ac are understood us
produced iu infinitum Ι say their distance (iu either
the hypothesis of ripht euple, or of acute euple) will
be preater thou any ussipuoble finite leupth. [²⁹]

Pnoos. In AM produced assume ΑΡ double of AM,
and let fall to AC produced the perpendicular ΡΝ.

The perpendicular MC will not be (from the pre·
ceding) in either hypothesis aforesaid greater than half
the perpendicular ΡΝ. Therefore ΡΝ will be at least
double MC, just as MC is at least double BD.

And so always, if in AM produced is assumed double
AP, and from the terminus of this a perpendicular is let
fall to AC produced.

’ It is obvious that the perpendicular, which from AM
ever more produced is let fall to AC produced, will be
a multiple of the determinate BD beyond any finite as·
signable number.

T herefore the distance of the aforesaid straights will
, be (in either aforesaid hypothesis) greater than any
assignable finite length.

. Quod erat demonstrandum.

COROLLARY.

But since the hypothesis of obtuse angle, which alone
could hinder here, is already proved absolutely false;
