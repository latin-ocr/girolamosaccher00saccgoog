angle at T) greater than LT, and this (because ol the

right angle at Q) will be greater than QT. T herefore “

LF will be much greater than QT. But hence; il in ΩΤ .
produced QK is taken equal to LF; the point K (from
P. XXXIV.) will pertain to the present curve, and there·
fore point T falls within the cavityol this curve.

Thereiore the straight FT, which cuts the two
straights QK, and LT in T, cannot be extended to cut
LS prolonged in the point X, situated without the cavity
of the present curve, unless previously the prolonged FT
cuts in some point O the portion of this curve situated
between the points S, and K. [90]

COROLLARY.

And hence manifestly flows‚ that between the tangent
ol this curve, and the curve itselt cannot be placed any
straight, which, on one or the other side of the tangent

wholly falls without the cavity of the curve; since a ’

straight so located must (from the preceding) make an
acute angle with the perpendicular let fall from the point
of contact to the opposite base.

The curve CKD, arisinp from the hypothesis of acute
duple, must be equod to the opposite bose ΑΒ.

Before the demonstration I premise the following
axiom.

If two lines be bisected‚ then their halves, and again
their quarters bisected‚ and so the process be continued
unilonnly in infinitum ; it will be saleto argue, those two ⁵
lines are equal to each other, as often as is ascertained,
or demonstrated in that uniform division in infinitum,
that at length must be attained two ol their mutually
