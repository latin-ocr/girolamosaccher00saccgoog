said figure as given, That Euclid is not guilty oi this error
is clear irorn the fact that he never presupposes the existence
oi the square as defined until after I. 46.

Confusion between the nominat and the reol definition
as thus described, i. e., the use of the former in demon-
stration before it has been turned into the latter by the
necessary prooi that the thing defined exists, is, according
to Saccheri, one oi the most fruitiul sources of illusory
demonstration, and the danger is greater in proportion to
the “complexim'’ oi the definition, i. e, the number of vari·
ety oi the attributes belonging to the thing defined. For
the greater is the possibility that there may be among the
attributes some that are incompatible, i. e, the simultaneous
presence oi which in a given figure can be proved, by means
oi other postulates, etc, forming part oi the basis oi the
science, to be impossible.

This signal anticipation oi Mill’s famous distinction
would alone justiiy the only known protagonist oi the
Logico demomtrotivo hitherto, Vailati, in saying oi Sac-
cheri: “This gives him the right to an eminent place in the
history of modern logic.'’

But in additional elaboration Saccheri broadens the mat-
ter, clearly recognizing the more general question relative
to the necessity oi excluding the possible existence of in·
competibility among the fundamental postulates made the
basis oi a demonstrative science; and not merely their
directly contradicting one another, but whether the falsity
oi one oi them could be proved by means of the others,
a thing not directly recognizable.

These questions, far from having grown old, are ac-
quiring an ever greater importance with the accentuation

· oi the modern tendency to regard as the fonction of mathe-

matics, the development, logically coherent, of the conse-
quences flowing from a given system oi premises‚ whether
or no these be susceptible oi a direct interpretation or ex-
perimenta} verification. γ

Since actually, in this case, the postulates assume the
Ι character oi simple hypotheses subject only to the condition
