consequently (from Eu. Ι. 13 and 15) alternate external
or internal angles equal to one another, or again, irom the
same cause, an external (as suppose DHX) equal to an in-
ternal and opposite HFX ; that, say I, those two straights
not even in their infinite production can meet one another.

For ii irom any point N of AX is let fall to ΒΧ the
perpendicular NR, this will be in the hypothesis oi acute
angle (which alone in any case can hinder us) greater
(irom P. ΙΙΙ., Cor. I.) than the common perpendicular
KL. Therefore those two straights AX, ΒΧ cannot ever
meet one another.

But furthermore here you have Eu. I. 27 and 28
demonstrated, aud indeed without immediate dependence
from the preceding 16 and 17 of the same First Book,
about [48] which difficulties could arise when the triangle
should be oi infinite sides on a finite base; to which sort
oi a triangle without doubt would reier¹ one who believed
that these two straights AX, ΒΧ met one another at least
at an'infinite distance, although the angles at the trans·
versal PFHD were such as we have supposed.

Moreover‚ on account of the demonstrated common
perpendicular KL, surely those two KX, LX cannot come
together toward the part oi the points X, since also (from
a superposition easily understood) toward the other part
also would meet at the same time the remaining and
, themselves unterminated KA, LB. Whereiore two
straights AX, ΒΧ would enclose a space; which is con· ·
trary to the nature of the straight line.

But these things are later. For in the preceding I
have never applied either Eu. Ι. 16 or 17, except where
clearly it treats oi a triangle bounded on every side, as κ .
indeed I promised I would so take care to do in the ’
Preface to the Reader.
