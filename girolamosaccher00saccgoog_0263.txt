(fig. 46) born oi it must be equal to the opposite base
AB. But now we deduce the contradictory from the
same hypothesis, that the curve

- CKD cannot be equal to that

base, since surely it is greater

than it. -
For that the curve CKD is

greater than the straight CD

joining its extremities, the no·

tion is common to all, which also Α

we may demonstrate from Eu.

Ι Ι. 20, that two sides oi a triangle

are always greater than the third; join CK, and KD;
and again join likewise the apices, first of two, then of
four, and so on in infinitum, the number oi the produced
segmenta doubling, until the whole curve CKD is under·
stood in this way to be exhausted, or to end in those
infinitely small chords, or tangents. .
, However here we may proceed from the common
notion alone.

But that the join CD is greater than the base AB, has
been demonstrated by us in P. III. from the very viscera
of the hypothesis of acute angle. ⁵ ,

Therefore the curve CKD, born of the hypothesis oi
acute angle, is certainly greater than the base AB, because
it is greater, anyhow from the· common notion, than the
straight CD, which from the hypothesis of acute angle
is demonstrated greater than the base AB. Therefore
cannot at the same time stand, that the curve CKD is
equal to the base AB. ’

Consequently is established that the hypothesis oi
acute angle is absolutely false, because it destroys itseli.
