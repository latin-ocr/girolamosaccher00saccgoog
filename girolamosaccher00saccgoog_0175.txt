an infinite distance. .

For again it would be requisite to demonstrate, that
any two straights existing in the same plane, upon which
a certain straight cutting makes two internal angles toward
the same parts less than two right angles nowhere else
can receive a common perpendicular.

But that, this demonstrated Euclidean geometry is
most exactly established, will be shown below.
