' end, that AXM with its fixed segnient AX can again be
so placed in that plane as to fit the other, AXF in so far

as truly the prolongation AXF toward the right is pre- -

cisely similar, or equal to the prolongation AXM toward
the left, and moreoyer the prolongation AXF toward
the left is precisely similar, or equal to the prolongation
AXM toward the right.

But since theare BC is greater than its part [79] ΜΡ,
and in this portion MF in like way may be designated
two other points with an interval less, without any certain Ι

· limit; truly one oi two things must happen in this ap .

proximation ol the aforesaid points.

One is, if at length is attained one and the same
intermediate point D, to which il XD is joined, such a¹
prolongation AXD is obtained, as alone is such as to be
wholly similar, or equal to itsell (comparison made be-
tween the left and the right side). ¹

The other is, if two such distinct points M, and F are ¹ ¹
found, to which XM, and XF being joined, two prolonga-
tions arise, one AXM, and the other AXF, of which each
is, in the way just explained, wholly similar, or equal. ,

But this second I prove to be impossible thus. For
from the yery terms can be established, that a'straight line
produced from the point A on through X, can take in
the plane only a single position, whilst obviously the
superadded XF lies altogether equally toward the lei,
and toward the right side oi the assumed, AX, or deviates
, not more toward the leit, than toward the right side oi

, it. Thereiore there will not be another prolongation
’ ΑΧΜ, which also lies altogether equally toward the left,

and toward the right oi this AX.
Obviously it holds that it cannot happen at tlre same

i tinre, both that the prolongation AXF toward the right
is wholly similar, or equal to itseli considered toward
the left, and that another prolongation AXM toward the
