over it.

Manganotti planned a reproduction ol the Euclides
uindicatum Alberto Pascal planned a complete Italian ver·
sion, saying, “We cannot call an Italian translation that pub-
lished by G. Boccardini, which with its curious abbreviated
demonstratione, with its suppression oi whole pages and
with its prudent transcription entire ol Latin passages not
easily translatable, truly knows not itselt what it is.”

Death vetoed these plans.

Meanwhile legends grow up and persist about Saccheri
himself. For example, no less an authority than a president
ol the New York Mathematical Society, misled by serape

οἱ· Saccheri’s Latin given'by Beltrami, has in an article “On .

the Early. History ol Non-Euclidean Geometry'’ (But. N.
Y. Mart. Soc, Vol. II, pp. 144-147) the sentence: “He con-
fessed to a distracting heretical tendency on his part in favor
of the hypothesis anguli acuti, a tendency against which,
Ι however, he kept up a perpetual struggle (diuturnum proe-

, lium).'' And this sentence is quoted without dissent in
The Monist, Vol IV, p. 489. Contrast the truth ol the

, matter by glancing at Saccheri's “Indicis loco'’ given below,

where the two quoted words occur (last sentence on' p. xii).

But inaccessible as he was, and legendary as he became, ’

Saccheri’s immortality was already assured. The name oi
his friend Ceva is carried by Ceva’s Theorem.

Coolidge in his Non-Euclidem Geometry names Sac-
cheri's the theorem: “In an isosceles birectangular· quadri-
lateral a line through the middle point ol the side adjacent
to both right angles, which is perpendicular to the line oi
that side, will be perpendicular to the line of the opposite
side and pass through its middle point. The other two
angles ot the quadrilateral are mutually congruent.'' In
1905 Bonola calls Saccheri’s the theorem: “If the angle-sum
in one triangle be equal to, greater than, or less than two
right angles, so will it be in every triangle.” But in 1896
Mansion had admirably chosen as Theorime de Sacchert:
“Dans l'hypothese oir la somme des angles d'un triangle est
