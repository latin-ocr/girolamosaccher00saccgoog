some point L. But now it holds that there may be as·
sumed in KB portions KK each equal to a certain assign-
able length R, and these more than any assignable finite
number; since indeed the point B cau be situated, in
accordance with the present supposition, at however great
a distance from this point Α.

And accordingly from the other points K are erected
to AB perpendiculars KH, KD‚ KP, which all (from
the aforesaid corollary) meet the straight AX in certain
points H, D, P; and so about the remaining pointsK
uniformly designated toward the point B.

It holds secondly (from Eu. Ι 16) that the angles
at the pointsL‚ H, D, Pwill all be obtuse toward the
parts of the points X; and just so (from Eu. Ι. 13) the
angles at the aforesaid points will all be acute toward
the point A. ’

Therefore (from Cor. II. to P. ΙΙΙ.) the side KH
will be greater than the side KL;·the side KD greater

than the side KH; and so always proceeding toward the ’

points X.

It holds thirdly that the four angles together of the
quadrilateral KLHK will be greater than the four angles
together of the quadrilateral KHDK: for this in like case
has already been demonstrated in P. XXI'V.

It holds fourthly that the same is valid likewise of
the quadrilateral KHDK in relation to the quadrilateral
KDPK; and so on always, proceeding to quadrilaterals
[58] more remote from this point A.

Since therefore are present (asin P. XXV.) as many
quadrilaterals described in the aforesaid mode, as there
are, except the first LK, perpendiculars let fall from points
of AX to the straight ΑΒ, it will hold uniformly (if we
assume nine perpendiculars of this sort let fall, besides
the first) the sum of all the angles which are compre-
hended by these nine quadrilaterals will exceed 35 right
