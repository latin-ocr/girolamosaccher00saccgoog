as suppose, toward the right, so that consequently, with·
out any change in AXB, this may be brought to con·
gruence with the other AXC in the same plane.

But it is manifestly contradictory, that on the other
hand, without any change of its prolongation, this can be
brought in the same plane into congruence with the other
AXM, which indeed at X divides that arbitrary angle
BXC.

For that the prolongation AXB is plainly other than
the prolongation AXM, if each is considered toward the
same part, whether left [76] or right, must be manifest
from this; because otherwise (as already observed in
like case) in such a situation AXB, AXM must mutu-
ally fit.

But neither can it be maintained, that the prolonga·
tion AXB toward one part, as suppose toward the left,
is wholly similar, or equal to the prolongation AXM
toward the opposite part, as suppose toward the right;
because otherwise the prolongation AXM toward the
right would plainly be similar, or equal to the prolonga-
tion AXC toward the same right side, because of the
assumed complete similitude, or equality between the just
cited prolongation, and that other AXB toward the left.

But then in such a situation (as previously remarked)
AXM, AXC should mutually fit; which is against the
present hypothesis

From all which, Ι infer: the assumed straight AXB
(in so far as it is understood to retain its arbitrary pro·
longation from the point A toward B) cannot have two
different positions in the same plane, in both of which
the portion indeed AX remains in the same location, but
the other portion XB in one of those two positions fits
(for example) XC, and in the other position fits XM.

Quod erat propositum.

I say thirdly: the assumed straight AXB can in no
