As substitute for Euclid’s, Borelli in 1658 proposed the
definition: “Parallels are coplanar straights with a common
perpendicular.” In 1756 the “famous” Robert Simson gave,
as basis fora “propi’' oi Euclid’s Postulate, a new Axiam:
“A straight line cannot approach toward, and then recede
from, a straight line without cutting it.” But in Saccheri's
Theorem not only occur, for the first time in the world,
straight lines which are asymptotes one of another, but
two perpendiculars to a straight line spread away from
each other as they go out; their points at two inches from
the straight line are farther apart than their points one inch
from the line. ·

Again, Geminos (circa 100 B.C.) defined parallels as
straights everywhere equidistant, but Giordano Vitale da
Bitonto (1680) saw that this presupposed the assumption
oi Clavius 1574, that a line coplanar with a straight and
everywhere equidistant from it is itself straight; so using
a figure iound in Clavius, made by j0ining together the ends
of two equal perpendiculars upon a straight, he tried to

'prove this join everywhere equidistant from the straight. ¹

To prove that a single point ol the join gives a perpendicular
equal to those from its ends, he shows would be sufficient.

We make the assumption of Clavius when, to draw a
straight line, we use a ruler and pencil. Saccheri shows
this is dependent on the “hypothesis oi right angle”; on the
other hypotheses the equidistant is curved; in obtuse, con-
vex to the given straight; in acute, concave.

The most beautiful theorem oi geometry is Euclid‚ III,
31: The angle in a semicircle is a right angle. But Sac-
cheri’s Proposition 18 is: According as an angle inscribed
ina semicircle is right, obtuse or acute, the hypothesis of
right, obtuse or acute angle is true.
