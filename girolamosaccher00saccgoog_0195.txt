(from the preceding proposition) without any certain
limit, to equality with a right angle, when indeed that
Ac is supposed to meet ΒΧ only at an z χ χ
infinite distance.

T herefore such an ordinate KMD
can be reached that at it the angle
ΑΜΚ exceeds a right angle by less
than the angle DAC. But then angle
ΒΑΕ, or ΒΑΜ, together with angle
AMDwill be greater thanaright angle.

Wherefore the obtuse angle ADM Α

being added, the three angles together Fig. ³³*

of the triangle ADM will be greater than two right
angles, which is against the hypothesis ol acute angle.
Therefore every straight Ac, which cuts that angle
BAX, finally at a finite or terminated distance (even in
the hypothesis of acute angle) must meet BX in a certain
point P.

Hence no straight AZ, which toward the parts ol the

ἵ points X makes an acute angle greater than BAX can
2 ever meet ΒΧ, either at a finite orat an infinite distance.

For as far as so should happen‚ now AX, dividing
angle BAZ, ought (against the prernised supposition)
to meet ΒΧ at a finite distance, as this is demonstrated
of the straight Ac dividing angle BAX.

COROLLARY 11.

Moreover it follows that no determinate acute angle
will be the maximum of all under which a straight line
produced from point A meets ΒΧ at linita distance.

For il toward the parts ol the point X you assume

2 any point higher than point Ρ, it follows that the straight
