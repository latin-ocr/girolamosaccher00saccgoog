But what I say for finding points between the points
C and K, the same also holds good uniformly for finding
points between the points K and D; oi course the curve

[88] CKD, arising irorn the hypothesis of acute angle, Ι

is the line joining the extremities of all equal perpendicu-
lars erected upon the same base toward the same part,

which assuredly can come under the name ordinates; it is, '

I may say, a line of such sort, that on account of the
hypothesis of acute angle, from which it ariseS, ¹it always
is concave toward the parts ol the opposite base AB.

Quod quidem hoc loco declarandum, ac demonstran-
dum a nobis erat.

PROPOSITION XXXV.

If from any point L of the base ΑΒ the ordinate LF is
drawn to wis curve CKD: I say the straight NFX
perpendicalw to LF must on both sides fall wholly
toward the conver parts of this curve, aad therefore
it will be tangent to wis curve.

Pnoor. For ii possible, let a certain point X (fig. 43)
. ol NFX fall within the cavity -
oi this curve. Let fall from η r·
the point X to the base AB the ς
perpendicular XP, which pro-

longed through X meets the

gn·

curve in a certain point R. Now

thus. In the quadrilateral LFXP

the angle at the pointXwill be Α ’“ ἨΜ 43 ³
neither right nor obtuse: else ς’ ’

(Ρ. V. and P. VI.) would be destroyed the present hy·
pothesis of acute angle.

Thereiore the aforesaid angle will be acute. Where-
fore (from Cor. 1. to P. III.) PX and so much more
PR will be greater than LF. But this is absurd (from
the preceding) against the nature oi this curve.
