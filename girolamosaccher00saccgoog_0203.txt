PROPOSITION XXXI.

N ow I soy there will be, of the aforesaid common perporo
diculors lu two distinct points, no determinate limit
such thot under o smoller oud smoller acute auqte ¹
made ot tlte point A, it would not always be possible
to attola (in tlte hypothesis of acute angle) to such a
common perpendiculor in two distinct points osis
less thou any ossipnoble length R.

, Pnoor. For in so far as the thing were otherwise;
ii from the point K (resume fig. 30) in ΒΧ assigned at
any however great distance from, “
the point B, a perpendicular KL
is erected, to which from point A
(by Eu. 1. 12) the perpendicular ι’,
AL is supposed let fall, KL ought *3²⁶ κ’,
to be greater than the length R.

The reason is ; because a higher
point Q being assumed in this ΒΧ,
from which is erected to BX the
perpendicular QF, to which (by Α
the same Eu. Ι. 12) a perpendic-
alar AF is let fall, this again must anyhow not be less ·
than the length R.

But KL (from Cor. to preceding proposition) will
be greater than QF. Thereiore KL would be greater
than the aforesaid length R. And so ever proceeding
higher.

But now, if this however great KB is supposed divided
(as in Ρ. XXV.) into portions KK„ equal to the length
R, and from these points K perpendiculars are erected‚
which meet AX in points H, D, M; the angles at these
points, toward the parts oi the point L, will neither be
right nor obtuse; lest in some quadrilatera, as suppose
