Ι should still observe, that also irorn the hypothesis

’ of obtuse angle is born a certain curve CKD, but convex

ffitoward the side oi the base C Η

hor MH (fig. 47) bisecting Fufi
perpendicular to them; and
greater (from Cor. Ι. to P. ΙΙΙ.) Α 5
than Ac, BD, in the hypothesis

Wherefore a certain portion MK of MH will be equal
to Ac, or BD.

Then CK and KD being joined, and the straights
it follows (again from P. ΙΙ.) that the joins PX, QN
will be perpendicular to the divided straights.

But again they will be (from the same Cor. I. to P.

’ ΑΒ, CD will be (from P. II.) ΙΙ
of obtuse angle. ⁵ ο
CK, AM, ΜΒ, ΚΙ) bisected in the points X, P, Q, N,
ΙΙΙ.) greater than Ac, MK, BD.

Hence; taking ot thern the portions PL, 98, which
are equal to the aforesaid; we shall have a curve, born
of the hypothesis of obtuse angle, which will go through
the points C, L, K, S, D. And so on always, it wekwish
to determine remaining points of the same curve.

But thence follows it will be convex toward the side κ

of the base AB. Now I grant in Just the same way
could have been demonstrated the equality of this curve
with its base AB.. But what good? None at all.

For just as the curve CKD must be thought, anyhow

from the common notion, greater than the straight CD;
so also (in P. ΙΙΙ.) the base AB is proved greater than
CD, when the hypothesis of obtuse angle holds. There-
fore from this side is nothing absurd‚ if the base AB be
equal to the aforesaid curve.
