ἵ then it had to be shown that the ⁴curved line, which (in

⁵ the hypothesis of acute angle) joins the extremities of

those equal perpendiculars‚ could only be concave toward

³ the base AB, and again the other curve, which (in the

hypothesis of obtuse angle) joins the extremities of the
same perpendiculars, only convex toward the same base.
But then the hypothesis indeed of acute angle from this
was demonstrated false ; because the line joining the ex·
tremities of the aforesaid perpendiculars was so far not
equal to the base AB, as on the contrary (anyhow from

' the common notion) it is greater than the straight join
CD, which from the nature of this hypothesis itself is s

greater than the aforesaid base ΑΒ. ι
But the hypothesis of obtuse angle had to be shown
from another source contradictory to itself, as in P. XIV:
But this now is enough
