IN PLACE OF AN INDEX

SHOULD BE ADDED, I THINK, WHAT FOLLOWS.

1. In Propp. Ι. and ΙΙ. oi the First Book
two principles are established, from which in
Propp. III. and IV. is proved, that interior an·
gles at the straight joining the extremities oi
equal perpendiculars erected toward the same
parts (in the same plane) irorn two points of
another straight, as base, not merely are equal
to each other, but besides are either right or
obtuse or acute according as that join is equal
to, or less, or greater than the aforesaid base:
and inversely. From popel on.

2. Hence occasion is taken to distinguish

’ three different hypotheses, one oi right angle,
another of obtuse, a third of acute: about which
in Propp. V., VI, and VII. is proved, that any
one oi these hypotheses is always alone true ii
it is found true in any one particular case. From pape 5 on.

3. Then after the interposition of three other
necessary propositions, is proved in Propp. XL,
XII., and XIII, the universal truth oi the fa-
mous axiom, respect being had to the first two
hypotheses, one of right angle, and the other
of obtuse; and at length in P. XIV. is shown
the absolute falsity of the hypothesis oi obtuse
