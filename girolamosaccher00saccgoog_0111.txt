finite or terminated distance) finally meet any perpen· ,

dicular erected upon this incident straight at whatever

finite distance.

ἰ From any triariqle ABC, of which (fio. 17) the arole ot

the point Β is inscribed in any semicircle of diameter
AC, is established the hypothesis of right onyle, or
obtuse ariole, or acute onyle, according ns indeed the
angle ot the point B is riyht, or obtuse, or ocule.

Pnoor. From the center D join DB. The angles at
the base AB will be (Eu. I. 5) equal, and likewise at
the base BC, in the triangles ADB,

· CDB. Wherefore, in the triangle

ABC the two angles at the base
AC will be together equal to the Α
. whole angle ABC. Therefore the
three angles of the triangle ABC
will be together equal t0, or greater, or less than two
right angles, according as the angle at the point B is right,
or obtuse, or acute.

Therefore from any triangle ABC, of which the angle ¹
at the point B is inscribed in any semicircle of diameter
AC, is established (P. XV.) the hypothesis of right angle,
or obtuse angle, or acute angle, according as indeed the
angle at the point B is right, or obtuse, or acute.

Quod erat demonstrandum.
