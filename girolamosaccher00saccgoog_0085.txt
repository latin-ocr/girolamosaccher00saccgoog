But it is evident this cannot happen, except aiter the
meetingoi the prolonged AD with PL in some point L

For ii the point T occurred before that meeting, the
perpendicular TR must cut PL in some point K. But
then in the triangle KPR would be found two right angles
at the points P and R; which is absurd (against Eu. 1.

Therefore it holds that the straights AD, PL meet
each other mutually (in the hypothesis oi right angle)
in some point (and indeed at a finite or tenninated dis·
tance) if they be produced toward that side, on which
with the transversal ΑΡ (oi finite length as great as
you choose) they make two angles together less than two
right angles.

PROPOSITION XII.
Apain I say also in the hypothesis of obtuse onqle tlte

stroipht AD will meet the straight PL somewhere

toward those ports (and indeed ot a finite, or termi-
noted distance).

Pnoor. For, as in the preceding proposition, DF
being assumed equal to AD, and the just noted perpen-
diculars let iall, I must show the join DM will be greater
than DF, or DA, and therefore (P. X.) the straight ΒΜ
will be greater than AB.

And in the first place DM will not be equal to DF.
Otherwise the angle DMF would be equal (Eu. I. 5) to
