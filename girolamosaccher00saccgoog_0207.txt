duple inclusive, hove a common perpendicular in two
distinct points with ΒΧ. [69] -

PRoos. First it holds (from Cor. II. to P. XXIX.)

that no determinate acute angle will
be the greatest oi all drawn under ι
which a straight from the point Α
meets the aforesaid ΒΧ· at a finite
distance· ’

Secondly, it holds in like manner
that (in the hypothesis of acut'e angle)
no acute angle will be the least oi all
drawn under which a straight has a n
common perpendicular in two distinct x
points with BX; since indeed (from what precedes)
there can be no determinate limit‚ such that there cannot
be found, under a lesser angle constituted at the point A,
a common perpendicular in two distinct points, which is
less than any assignable length¹ R.

And hence follows thirdly‚ that (in this hypothesis)
there must be a certain determinate acute angle BAX,
drawn under which AX so approaches ever more to ΒΧ,
that only at an infinite distance does it meet it.

But further that this AX is a lirnit in part from within
in part from without of each of the aforesaid classes of
straights is proved thus, First, it agrees with those
straights which meet ΒΧ at a finite distance since it also
finally meets; but it differs, because it meets only at an
infinite distance.

But secondly it also agrees with, and at the same time
differs from those straights which have a common per-
pendicular in two distinct points with BX; because it also
has a common perpendicular with BX; but in one and the
same point X infinitely distant. But this latter ought to
