this Ι)Β produced outwardly. Therefore AM and CM
being joined, the angle AMC will be acute, because less

Thereiore (from the preceding proposition) is estah

PROPOSITION XX

Let there be a trianple ACM (fio. 19) right-onpled ot C.
Thon from the pointB bisectinp this ΑΜ let fall tha
perpendiculo BD to AC. I sap rtis perpendiculo

will not be (in the hypothesis of acute onple) preater
than half the perpendiculor MC.

Paoos. For let DB be produced to DH double DB.
Therefore DH would be (if Ι)Β be Α

greater than the aforesaid half) A
greater than CM, and therei ore

equal to a certain continuation
CMK. ”wll
Join AH, ΗΚ, ΗΜ, MD. Now A

we proceed thus. Since rn the tri-
angles HBA, DBM, the sides ΗΒ,
BA are assumed equal to the sides
DB, BM; and (Eu. Ι. 15) the P Ν

angles at the point B are equal; Fig. 19.
the ωδε ΗΑ ³¹⁵⁰ (ΕΜ Ῑ· 4) will be equal to the base

MD. Then, by the same reasoning, in the triangles
ΗΒΜ, DBA, the bases HM, DA will be equal. Where-

fore in the triangles MHA, ADM, the angles MHA,
ADM (Eu. Ι. 8) will be equa.

Again in the triangles AHB‚ MDB‚ the residual angle
MHB will remain equal to the residual right angle ADB.
Therefore the angle MHB will be right. But this is ah
