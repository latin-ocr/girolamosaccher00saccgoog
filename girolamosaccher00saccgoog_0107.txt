BAH to the right angle at A; and again in those two
triangles equal angles are adjacent to this side ΗΒ, which
are in the first triangle indeed the angle BHD, and in the
latter the angle HBA; also (Eu. 1. 26) the remaining
angle HBD in the former triangle will be equal to the
remaining angle BHA in the latter triangle. Wherefore
the entire angle DBA will be equal to the entire angle

Now however, neither oi the aforesaid equal angles
will be obtuse, lest we meet (from the preceding propo-
sition) a case oi the now rejected hypothesis of obtuse
angle.

Nor will either be right, lest we meet (from the
same preceding) a case oi the hypothesis oi right angle,
which (P. V.) will leave no place ior the hypothesis of
acute angle. Thereiore each one oi those angles will be
acute. This being the case: that the straight BD pro·
duced cannot meet in a certain point K this AH produced
toward the same parts, is demonstrated thns; because in
the triangle KDH, besides the right angle at D, is present
the obtuse angle at H, since the angle AHD in the afore·
said hypothesis oi acute angle is proved acute. But this
is absurd‚ against Eu. I. 17. -

“ Therefore it cannot hold good in this hypothesis, that

any BD, making with an arbitrarily small straight AB
any acute angle toward the parts of this AH, will at
length at a finite, or terminated distance, meet this ΑΗ
produced.

Quod erat demonstrandum.

The same otherwise and more easily.

Two perpendiculars AK, ΒΜ stand on a certain
straight AB, as small as you choose (fig. 16). [2⁵] From
any point M of this ΒΜ let fall to AK the perpendicular
MH, and join BH. It follows that the angle BHM will
