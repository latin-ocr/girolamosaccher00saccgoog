It is certain first that as to all its points the whole
diameter MAN will remain in the same place; lest two
straight lines (against the preceding Lemma Ι) inclose a
space.

It is certain secondly that no point K of the circum·
ferente NKM will fall either within, or without the sur·
lace inclosed by the diameter MAN, and the other eir-
cumierence NHDM; lest obviously against the nature oi
the circle, one radius, for example AK, be less, or greater
than another radius of the same circle, ior example AH.

It is certain thirdly that any radius MA can alone be
prolonged in a straight line .by [84] a certain other radius
AN, lest (against the preceding Lemma ΙΙ) two lines
assumed straight, as suppose MAN, MAH, should have
one and the same common segment MA.

It is certain fourthly (from the immediately preceding
lemma) that all the diameters of the circle cut one an-
other in the center, and from the known nature oi the
circle biseet. ¹

From all which can be established, that not only the
diameter MAN most exactly divides its circle, and the
circumference of it into two equal parts, but also that
this may be assumed universally for any diameter oi this
circle. Quod erat etc.

SCHOLION.

We read in Clavius that this truth was demonstrated

by Thales of Miletus, but perhaps not to the exhausting
oi every objection.

LEMMA V.

Among rectilineor angles, ull ripht angles ore exoctly
equod to one another, without any deviu-
tion even infinitely matt.

Pnoos.. Euclid defines a rectilinear' angle as right:
witichis equo! to its adjacent. This he does not postu·
