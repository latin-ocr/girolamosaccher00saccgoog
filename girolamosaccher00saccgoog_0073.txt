hand the angle BXH is obtuse ; and, on the other, ii XM
be joined, the angle BXM (Eu. I. 17) is acute. Then
however, since the quadrilateral XBMP contains three
right angles, from what has just now been noted, and
one obtuse (Eu. I. 16) at the point P, because it is exter·
nal in relation to the internal and opposite right angle at
the point H of the triangle PHX; the side XP will be
( Cor. 1.‚ P. ΙΙΙ.) less than the opposite ΒΜ. Wherefore,
assuming in ΒΜ the portion BF equal to this XP, the
angles at the join PF will be (P. Ι.) mutually equal,
certainly obtuse, since the angle BFP (Eu. 1. 16) is ob
tuse because oi the right angle interior and opposite
ΙΡΜΡ. Therefore the hypothesis oi obtuse angle abides
lor any base ΒΧ.

But, as above, this hypothesis abides for this base
BX, however much the equal perpendiculars are aug-
mented or diminished at will. Therelore it holds, that
ii even in a single case the hypothesis of obtuse angle
is true, always in every case it alone is true.

’ Quod erat demonstrandum.

PROPOSITION VII.

If even in o single case llve hypothesis of acute angle
is true, always v'u every case il olom is true.

Puooe is very easily given. For ii the hypothesis oi
acute angle should permit any case oi either other hypoth-
esis, either of right angle, oroi obtuse angle, now (from ¹
'the two preceding [10] propositions) no place would be left
for the hypothesis of acute angle; which is absurd.

Therefore il even in a single case the hypothesis of
acute angle is true, always in every case it alone is true.

Quod erat demonstrandum.
