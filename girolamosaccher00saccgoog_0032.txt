vestigation of the consequences flowing from the other
two alternative hypotheses to which the negation of the
Parallel Postulate gave rise, attaining thus results fitting
to carry on in their sequence to a discovery far more im·
portant than what he had in mind to reach, namely to the
discovery of a wholly new geometry of which the old is only
a simple particular case.

“In this regard‚ his position is not unworthy to be com-
pared with that of his great fellow-countryman Columbus,
who, precisely in hopes of being able to reach by a new way
regions already known, was led to the discovery of a new
continent.”

Twisting Vailati’s fine comparison, Saccheri's file of
Indians' turned out to be Columbians (Americans).

Realizing its importance as the coconut out of whose
eyes the palm was to shoot up, which rises high above the
flat and circumscribed old world, let us further look at the
little Lopica.

Its Chapter 9, of Part I, deduces the ordinary rules of
the scholastic logie, relative to the conversion of propositions
and to the construction of the various kinds of syllogisms,
by a procedure imitating that followed by geometers in their
treatises, and notes how in such procedure it is often neces-
sary to have recourse to the assumption that, given any
term, it is always possible to find other terms which are
not coextensive with it nor with its negation⁸ It proposes
then to reelaborate the same subject. following a method
other and more refined (aliam nobiliorem mom) with which
there is no need of using the mentioned postulate.

This aim is attained by taking as point of departure,
those among the propositions antecedently proved in whose
demonstration no use has been made of the assumption in
question, and by deducing from these, recourse being had to
the1x-12 form of argument, the remaining propositions,
which before bad been obtained by using the assumption

thus eliminated.
